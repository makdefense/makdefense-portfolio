*** Using LOKI and its Yara rule set ***

> After reading the sections within Yara THM room i was given my first task within the "Using LOKI and its Yara rule set" section. For my first question i had to play the role of a security analyst for a
mid-size law firm and scan suspicious files on a web server within my organization. I had to first scan "file1" which was located within the "suspicious-files" directory, i had to figure out if Loki
detected the file as suspicious/malicious or benign. To do this i first launched the Yara VM and waited for it to load up. After the VM loaded i then navigated to the "suspicious-files" directory by
inputting the command "cd suspicious-files," then "enter," then "cd file1," then "enter." To run the scan i inputted the command sythax of "python ../../tools/Loki/loki.py -p ." then "enter."

> I then had to figure out the Yara rule that the file matched on. To figure this out i just naviagated through the scan results and saw that it was matched on "webshell_metaslsoft."

> I then had to figure out the classification of the file by Loki. To figure this out i simply navigated through the scan results and saw that it was classified as "Web Shell."

> Next i had to figure out what string within he Yara rule did the output match on. To figure this out i just look through the scanned output and saw that the string was "Str1."

> I then had to figure the name and version of the hack tool. To figure this out i simply looked through the scanned output and saw that the name and version was "b374k 2.2" which was stored within
"FIRST_BYTES."

> I then had to inspect the actual Yara file that flagged file 1 and figure out how many strings were there to flag the file. After viewing the yara file i discovered that there was 1 string to flag
file 1.

> Following, i had to scan file 2 which was within the same "suspicious-files" directory and determine whether Loki detected the file as suspicious/malicious or benign. To figure this out i simply
inputted the command "cd files2," then "enter," then "python ../../tools/Loki/loki.py -p ." then "enter."

> After initiating the scan and completing it the results showed that the file was OK.

> For the last question of this practical i had to inspect "file2" and figure out the name and version of the web shell. To go about this i first inputted the command "cat 1ndex.php," then "enter,"
then "more cat 1ndex.php," then "enter." This then returned the name and version of the webshell to be "b374k 3.2.3."

*** Creating Yara rules with yarGen *** 

> For my next task in first had to generate a rule for "file2" that was in the "suspicious-files" directory. To do so i had to first navigate to the directory "/tools/yarGen," then input the command
"python3_yarGen.py -m /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/file2 --excludegood -o /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/file2.yar," then "enter."

> This then created the rule for "file2."

> Moving on to the first question of this practical i had to figure out what command i would use to test Yara and my rule against file 2 from within the root of the suspicious files directory.
To carry out the test i had to first navigate to the "suspicious-files" directory, then input the command syntax
"yara file2.yar file2/1ndex.php home_cmnatic_suspicious_files_file2_1ndex file2/1ndex. php," then "enter."

> I then had to copy the rule i created into the Loki signatures directory. To do so i navigated back to the main root directory then inputted the command
"mv /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/files2.yar /home/cmnatic/tools/Loki/signature-base/yara/," then "enter."

> I then had to test the rule with Loki to see if it flags file 2. After running the test it was confirmed that it does flag file 2.

> For the next question i had to figure out the name of the variable for the string that it matched on. To figure this out i simply scrolled down to the scan results and saw that the variable name
was "Zepto."

> I then had to figure out how many strings were generated. To figure this out i exited the Loki scan, then navigated to the directory "signature-base" that was in the "tools" directory, inputted the
command "nano file2.yar," then "enter."

> After entering the nano editor for "file2.yar" it was discovered that they were a total of 20 strings.

> For the final question of this practical i had to figure out one of the conditions to match on the Yara rule which was specifically a the file size. After scrolling through the nano editor for
"file2.yar" it was discovered that the file has to be less that 700KB to match on the yara rule.
