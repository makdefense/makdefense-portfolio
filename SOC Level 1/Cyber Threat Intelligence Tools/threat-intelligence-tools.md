## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding the basics of threat intelligence & its classifications, which is that it gives you context and confidence - it turns noisy alerts into
actionable decisions, helps you prioritize defenses, reduces mean-time-to-detect/response, and lets you anticipate attacker behavior instead of just reacting. Next, I learned about the importance of
understanding how to use UrlScan.io to scan for malicious URLs, which is that it gives you a fast, safe, and richly instrumented way to inspect live web pages and extract high-value indicators - so you
can triage phishing/malicious links, feed intel into detection workflows, and automate checks across your org. I then learned about the importance of understanding how to use Abuse.ch to track malware
and botnet indicators which is that abuse.ch gives you free, community-driven, production-quality threat data (malicious URLs, malware samples, botnet IPs and feeds) that you can use to triage hunt,
block, and analyze threats faster and safer - and learning how to use it turns raw alerts into actionable defenses. Following, I learned about the importance of understanding how to investigate
phishing emails using PhishTool, which is that PhishTool accelerates safe, repeatable, and evidence-quality phishing investigations, and learning it teaches you the exact steps, signals, and automation
that turn a suspicious email into actionable intelligence and containment. Ultimately, I gained insight into the significance of utilizing Cisco's Talos Intelligence platform for effective intelligence
gathering and analysis. Cisco Talos provides massive, vetted telemetry, along with expert research, that can be used to triage, enrich, block, and respond to real threats quickly.

> For the first question, I had to determine the social media platform the attacker was trying to impersonate within the email. To figure this out, I just opened the email with the application
"Thunderbird" which was located on the THM AttackBox, and observed that the attacker was attempting to impersonate "LinkedIn."

> <img width="653" height="212" alt="tit8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2191ba0d-9da7-4d73-b547-69222717c00c" />

> For the next question, I had to figure out the sender's email address. To figure this out, I navigated to the top of the email within the Thunderbird application and saw that the sender's
email address was "darkabutla@sc500.whpservers.com."

> <img width="408" height="113" alt="tit9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3bc7bcd-4e21-447b-90b5-67d446552167" />

> For the next question, I had to figure out the recipient's email address. To figure this out, I did the same thing, navigated to the top of the email within the Thunderbird application, and saw that
thereciever's email address was "cabbagecare@hotsmail.com."

> <img width="547" height="80" alt="tit10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03c05299-c18c-4d95-9ef1-05244e11d908" />

> For the last question of this task, I had to figure out the Originating IP address and then defang it. So, to go about this, the first thing I did was navigate to the Desktop, double-clicked on
the emails folder, then right-clicked on "Email1.eml," and selected open with "Pluma."

> <img width="645" height="323" alt="tit11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a02d4aea-1fa2-4871-b868-c85f75be1ade" />

> After opening the email file with Pluma, I then navigated to the IP address that was under received, which was the IP address of "204.93.183.11."

> <img width="417" height="220" alt="tit12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57745a93-84dc-40e7-90cb-528d7391bd74" />

> I then went to Google Chrome and launched CyberChef, searched "Defang" within the input field under Operations, and selected "Defang IP addresses."

*** Cisco Talos Intelligence ***

> For my next task, I had to use information that I gathered from inspecting "Email1.eml" to answer a few questions using Cisco Talos Intelligence. For the first question i had to figure out the listen
domain of the IP address of "204.93.183.11." To figure this out, I navigated to the website "https://talosintelligence.com/," then copied and pasted the IP address "204.93.183.11" into the input field
that was under "Intelligence Center."

*** Scenario 1 ***

> For my following scenario, I had to analyze another suspicious email, called "Email2.eml," which was located on the THM AttackBox Desktop in the Emails folder and answer a few questions.

> <img width="736" height="369" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-12 at 10 29 32â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ade5264-a3b4-46e8-a39b-87776d918353" />

> For the first question, I had to figure out the recipient's email address. To figure this out, I navigated to the "Email2.eml" file, double-clicked it to open it with Thunderbird, navigated to the
top, and saw that the recipient's email address was "chris.lyons@supercarcenterdetroit.com."

> <img width="558" height="319" alt="tit20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9659c3-372f-4bf7-809d-c0b7da24e607" />

> For the last question in this scenario, I had to figure out which Detection Alias the email file "Email2.eml" could be identified by, based on the information provided by VirusTotal. To figure this
out, I first went back to the VM on THM, launched the Terminal application, inputted the command "ls," then "enter" to list all directories. After locating the Desktop directory, I then input the
command "cd Desktop," then "Enter," then "ls," then "Enter" to list all files within the Desktop directory. After locating the "Emails" directory, I inputted the command "cd Emails," then "Enter," then
"ls," then "Enter" to list all files within the "Emails" directory. After locating the file "Email2.eml," I entered the command "sha256sum Email2.eml" and then pressed "Enter" to retrieve the hash of
the email file, which was "97028b1b198af6da1043b78e40e1efe519fe3def754cd9d1f29380ca11e5c361."

*** Scenario 2 ***

> For my following scenario, I had to analyze another suspicious email, called "Email3.eml," which was located on the THM AttackBox Desktop in the Emails folder and answer a few questions.

> <img width="715" height="374" alt="tit24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9eff8b9-98dd-4fa0-b0bd-7605800ec4d7" />

> For the first question, I had to figure out the name of the attachment that was on the "Email3.eml." To figure this out, I just double-clicked on the email file to open it with Thunderbird,
clicked on the attached file at the bottom of the email, and saw that the name of the file was "Sales_Receipt 5606.xls."

> <img width="812" height="601" alt="tit25" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1719c96f-7f9e-429c-8279-eaeb12c9a67b" />

> For the last question, I had to determine the malware family associated with the "Email3.eml" file. To resolve this, I had to retrieve the SHA-256 hash. To get this, I launched the
"Terminal" application that was on the THM AttackBox, then inputted the command "ls," then "enter" to list all the directories. After locating the Desktop directory, I then input the command "cd
Desktop," then "Enter," then "ls," then "Enter" to list all the files within the Desktop directory. After locating the "Emails" directory, I inputted the command "cd Emails," then "Enter," then "ls,"
then "Enter" to list all files within the "Emails" directory. After locating the file "Email3.eml," I then input the command "sha256sum Email3.eml," then "enter" to retrieve the hash of the email
file, which was "f4d97603256a36e81bfe7ef5e0ccaee44f77de6bb041fa41f0b3a0db53f4aba9."
