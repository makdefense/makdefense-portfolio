> For the first question i had to figure out the social media platform the attacker was trying to pose as within the email. To figure this out i just open the email with the application "ThunderBird"
which was located on the THM AttackBox and saw that the attacker was trying to pose as "LinkedIn."

> For the next question i had to figure out the senders email address. To figure this out i simply just navigated to the top of the email within the ThunderBird application and saw that the sender's
email address was "darkabutla@sc500.whpservers.com."

*** Cisco Talos Intelligence ***

> For my next task i had to use information that i gathered from inspecting "Email1.eml" to answer a few questions using Cisco Talos Intelligence. For the first question i had to figure out the listen
domain of the IP address of "204.93.183.11." To figure this out i navigated to the website "https://talosintelligence.com/," then copied and pasted the IP address "204.93.183.11" into the input field
that was under "Intelligence Center."

*** Scenario 1 ***

> For my next scenario i had to analyze another suspicious email called "Email2.eml" which was located on the THM AttackBox Desktop in the Emails folder and answer a few questions.

> For the last question for this scenario i had to figure out which Detection Alias can the email file "Email2.eml" be identified by, from the information given by VirusTotal. To figure this out i first
went back to the VM on THM, launched the Terminal application, inputted the command "ls," then "enter" to list all directories. After locating the Desktop directory, i then inputted the command "cd
Desktop," then "Enter," then "ls," then "Enter" to list all files within the Desktop directory. After locating the "Emails" directory i inputted the command "cd Emails," then "Enter," then "ls," then
"Enter" to list all files within the "Emails" directory. After locating the file "Email2.eml," i then inputted the command "sha256sum Email2.eml," then "enter" to retrieve the hash of the email file
which was "97028b1b198af6da1043b78e40e1efe519fe3def754cd9d1f29380ca11e5c361."

> I then went to Google Chrome and navigated to "https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload," copied and pasted the hash "97028b1b198af6da1043b78e40e1efe519fe3def754cd9d1f29380ca11e5c361" into the input
field above.

*** Scenario 2 ***

> For my next scenario i had to analyze another suspicious email called "Email3.eml" which was located on the THM AttackBox Desktop in the Emails folder and answer a few questions.

> For the first question i had to figure out the name of the attachment that was on the "Email3.eml." To figure this out i just double-clicked on the email file to open up the file with ThunderBird,
clicked on the attached file at the bottom of the email, and saw that the name of the file was "Sales_Receipt 5606.xls."

> For the last question i had to figure out the malware family that was associated with the "Email3.eml" file. To figure this out i had to retrieve the SHA256 hash. To get this i launched the
"Terminal" application that was on the THM AttackBox, then inputted the command "ls," then "enter" to list all the directories. After locating the Desktop directory, i then inputted the command "cd
Desktop," then "Enter," then "ls," then "Enter" to list all the files within the Desktop directory. After locating the "Emails" directory i inputted the command "cd Emails," then "Enter," then "ls,"
then "Enter" to list all files within the "Emails" directory. After locating the file "Email3.eml," i then inputted the command "sha256sum Email3.eml," then "enter" to retrieve the hash of the email
