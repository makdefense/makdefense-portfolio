## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

*** OpenCTI Dashboard 1 ***

> After reading through the section "OpenCTI Dashboard 1" i was tasked with a minipractical to do. For the first question i had to figure out the group that uses the 4H RAT malware. To figure this out
i had to first launch Mozilla FireFox within the THM AttackBox and navigated to the website "http://10.201.99.184:8080/" which launched the login screen for OpenCTI.

> After using the login credentials "info@tryhack.io" and "TryHackMe1234" to login to the dashboard, i then navigated to the left an clicked "Arsenal," then saw that the group "Putter Panda" uses the
"4H RAT" malware.

> Moving onto the next qeustion i had to figure out what kill-chain phase is linked with the "Command-Line Interface" Attack Pattern. To figure this out i simply navigated to the top of the application,
selected "attack patterns, searched "command-line," and saw that the kill-chain phase "execution-ics" popped up.

> For the last question i had to figure out i had to figure out which tab would house the indicators. To figure this out i simply just navigated around the application and saw that the tab
"Observations" within the "Activities" category housed the "Indicators."

> Moving onto the next mini practical for the first question i had to figure out which intrusion sets are associated with the Cobalt Strike malware with a Good confidence level. To figure this out i first
navigated to the "Arsenal" tab, searched "Cobalt Strike," and selected it.

*** Investigative Scenario ***

> For this practical i had to play the role of a SOC analyst and look into both "CaddyWiper" malware and "APT37" group with OpenCTI and answer questions. For the first question i had to figure out the
earliest date recorded related to CaddyWiper. To figure this out i navigated to the left of the dashboard, selected "Arsenal," searched for "CaddyWiper," and selected it.

> For the next question i had to figure out the Attack Technique used by the "CaddyWiper" malware for execution. To figure this out i navigated to the top of the dashboard, selected "Knowledge," then
scrolled all the way down to the first Attack Technique and saw that it was "Native API."

> Next question i had to fiugre out how many malware relations were linked to this Attack Technique. To figure this out i selected "Native API," navigated to the top of the dashboard, selected "knowledge,"
and saw under "DISTRIBUTION OF RELATIONS" the total number of malware relations were 113.
