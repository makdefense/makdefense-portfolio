# [Cyber Threat Intelligence]

## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding MISP and why it was developed, which is that MISP exists to make sharing, storing, and operationalizing threat intelligence fast, structured,
and machine-readable - and learning it gives you the skills to automate enrichment, correlate IOCs into campaigns, and get intelligence into detection and response tools. Moving on, I then learned about
the importance of understanding MISP core features and terminologies, which are the language and tools of threat-sharing - knowing them makes you reliably share, consume, automate, and act on
CTI instead of drowning in raw lists and email attachments. Next, I learned about the importance of understanding how to navigate the MISP's dashboard, which is that knowing it turns noisy feeds into fast,
confident decisions, speeds incident triage, and surfaces the proper context (sightings, events, correlations) without wasting time hunting for info. Following, I learned about the importance of
understanding MISP event creation and management, which is that they are the unit of truth in MISP - they package evidence, context, and action. Suppose you can create and manage high-quality events. In
that case, you turn raw alerts and IOCs into sharable, machine-readable intelligence that actually helps defenders (and partners) detect, block, and investigate threats. Finally, I learned about the
importance of understanding MISP feeds and taxonomies, which is that they are the plumbing and language of actionable threat intel - knowing them and you'll be able to ingest valid data, filter noise,
automate trusted exports, and make intelligence reliably consumable by hunters, SIEMs, and EDRs.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

*** Scenario Event ***

> After reading the sections within MISP, I was given a scenario event to complete. I had to investigate an event and correlate the details with my SIEM, which CIRCL published with "PupyRAT" infection.
For the first question, I had to determine the event ID assigned to the "PupyRAT" event. To figure this out, I first launched the MISP by going to Mozilla Firefox and inputting the website
"https://10-201-89-204.reverse-proxy-us-east-1.tryhackme.com/" into the input field, then pressing "enter."

> After logging into the MISP with the credentials "Username: Analyst@THM.thm" and "Password: Analyst12345&", I then navigated to the right of the home page and inputted "PupyRAT" within the input field
of the events filter, then pressed "filter."

> When I pressed "filter," it popped up the event "PupyRAT."

> I then navigated to the left of the filter result and saw the event ID of "1145."

> For the next question, I had to figure out what specifically the adversary was gaining from organizations. To figure this out, I navigated around the search results and saw that the "malware type" was
"Remote Access."

> Moving on to the next question, I had to determine the IP address that has been mapped to the "PupyRAT C2 Server." To figure this out, I hovered over to the right of the page and selected the "view"
icon.

> After clicking the view icon, I scrolled down to "network activity" and saw the IP address "89.107.62.39" listed as the command-and-control server.

> For the second-to-last question, I had to figure out which attack group is known to use this attack type in the "Intrusion Set Galaxy." To figure this out, I just navigated to the top and saw
within the "Tags," the attack group was "Magic Hound."

> For the final question, I had to figure out which taxonomy tag was set to a Certainty level of 50. To figure this out, I just navigated to the "Tags" area and saw under the certainty level of 50
the tag set was "OSINT."

## Reflection

> This lab provided me with knowledge about MISP as a threat sharing platform.
