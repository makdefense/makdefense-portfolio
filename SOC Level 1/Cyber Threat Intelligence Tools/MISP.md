*** Scenario Event ***

> After reading the sections within MISP i was given a scenario event to complete, i had to investigate an event and correlate the details with my SIEM that was published by CIRCL with "PupyRAT" infection.
For the first question i had to figure out the event ID that has been assigned to the "PupyRAT" event. To figure this out i first launched the MISP by going to Mozilla FireFox and inputting the website
"https://10-201-89-204.reverse-proxy-us-east-1.tryhackme.com/" into the input field, then pressing "enter."

> After logging into the MISP with the credentials "Username: Analyst@THM.thm" and "Password: Analyst12345&" i then navigated to the right of the home page and inputted "PupyRAT" within the input field
of the events filter, then pressed "filter."

> When i pressed "filter" it popped up the event "PupyRAT."

> I then navigated to the left of the filter result and saw the event ID of "1145."

> For the next question i had to figure out what specifically the adversary was gaining into organizations. To figure this out i simply navigated around the search result and saw the "malware type" to be
"Remote Access."

> Moving onto the next question i had to figure out the IP address that has been mapped as the "PupyRAT C2 Server." To figure this out i hovered over to the right of the page and selected the "view"
icon.

> After clicking the view icon i scrolled down to "network activity" and saw the IP address of "89.107.62.39" mapped as the command and control server.

> For the second to last question i had to figure out which attack group is known to use this form of attack from the "Intrusion Set Galaxy." To figure this out i just navigated to the top and saw
within the "Tags" that the attack group was "Magic Hound."

> For the final question i had to figure out what was the taxonomy tag set with a Certainty level of 50. To figure this out i just navigated to the "Tags" area and saw under the certainty level of 50
the tag set was "OSINT."
