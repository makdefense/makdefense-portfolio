*** Log Analysis ***

> For this room, I began by answering questions under this section. For the first question, I had to investigate a "access.log" file on the Desktop that shows a denial-of-service.
I had to figure out the attacker's IP address. To figure this out, i launched the "access.log" file that was on the Desktop, then navigated through the results to find repeated
"GET" requests that seemed suspicious. After investigating i determined the attacker's IP address to be "203.12.23.195."

## Reflection

> This lab strengthened my ability to detect post-exploitation activity by analyzing logs, filesystem artifacts, and attacker command execution patterns.
