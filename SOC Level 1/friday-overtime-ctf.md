*** Challenge Scenario ***

> For this room i had to complete a practical where i had to take charge of a ticket at PandaProbe Intelligence as a CTI analyst. The ticket was considered to be a potential breach, because it contained
multiple file attachments, presumed to be malware samples. For the first question i had to figure out who shared the malware samples. To go about figuring this out i had to first launch the VM within
THM, then launch Chromium.

> After launching chromium, i was directed to a landing page with the header "Panda Probe Intelligence," i had to then use the credentials "Username: ericatracy" and "Password: Intel321!" to login into
the DocIntel platform.

> After logging into the platform, i was then directed to the file attachment that showed it was shared by "Oliver Bennett."

> Moving onto the second question i had to then figure out the SHA1 hash of the file "pRsm.dll" inside samples.zip. To figure this out i navigated to the right of the platform and selected the document
under "Latest documents."

> After selecting that, i was then directed to a "samples.zip" file under "File Attachments" when i clicked the "samples.zip" file it downloaded the file onto the system within the "Downloads" folder.

> After downloading the "samples.zip" file, i then double-clicked the file to open it and located the "pRsm.dll" file that needed to be unzipped to acquire its SHA1 hash value.

> So to unzip this file, i navigated back to the DocIntel platform to retrieve the password to the attached archive and saw that it was "Panda321!"

> Afte getting the password, i then launch the "Terminal" application, then inputted the command "pwd" to confirm the current directory i was in. After typing the command i saw that i was in "/ericatracy"
directory.

> I then navigated to the "Downloads" directory which held the "samples.zip" file by inputting the command "cd Downloads." Then to unzip the "samples.zip" file i inputted the command "unzip samples.zip,"
then "enter," then was prompted to enter the password, which was "Panda321!" After entering the password every file within the attached archive was unzipped.

> To retrieve the SHA1 hash value for "pRsm.dll" file inputted the command "sha1sum pRsm.dll," then "enter," and retrieved the SHA1 hash value of "9d1ecbbe8637fed0d89fca1af35ea821277ad2e8."

> Moving onto the third question, i to figure out which malware framework utilizes these DLLs as add-on modules. To figure this out i launch "Google Chrome" on my system and googled "pRsm dll malware
framework," then clicked on the first link that popped up which was by "WeLiveSecurity."

> Moving onto the fourth question i had to figure out which MITRE ATT&CK Technique was linked to using pRsm.dll in within the "MgBot" framework. To figure this out i just scrolled down and saw that the
Technique was "T1123."
