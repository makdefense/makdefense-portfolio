## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding the Pyramid of Pain which is that it teaches you which indicators usually hurt an attacker when you detect or block them - and it shows you how
to prioritize detection, hunting, and remediation so your defensive effort gives the biggest payoff.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

*** Hash Values ***

> After reading the sections within the Pyramid of Pain, I was given my first question under the topic "Hash Values (Trivial)." Which was to analyze the report associated with the hash
"b8ef959a9176aef07fdca8705254a163b50b49a17217a4ff0107487f59d4a35d" to figure out the file name. So to answer this question, I clicked the given link where the report was, navigated around, and saw that
the file name was "Sales_Receipt 5606.xls" under the hash value of "b8ef959a9176aef07fdca8705254a163b50b49a17217a4ff0107487f59d4a35d."

*** IP Address ***

> Next, I was given my second question under the topic "IP Address (Easy)", which was to read a report to figure out both the first IP address and the domain name the malicious process (PID 1632) attempted
to communicate with. To figure this out, I just clicked the link where the report was and navigated through the pages of the report, and saw that under "Network Activity," the first IP address was
"50.87.136.52" and the first domain was "craftingalegacy.com."

*** Domain Names (Simple) ***

> I was then given my third question under the topic "Domain Names (Simple)" which was to provide the redirected website for the shortened URL using a preview: "https://tinyurl.com/bw7t8p4u."
To provide this, I just went to "Google Chrome," copied and pasted "https://tinyurl.com/bw7t8p4u" into the search field, and added a "+" sign at the end. This provided me with the URL
"https://tryhackme.com/."

*** Host Artifacts ***

> Following this, I was given my next question within the topic "Host Artifacts (Annoying)", which was to determine the IP address of a process that makes a POST request to an IP address based in the
United States on port 8080. To figure this out, I had to click on a link with a report, then scroll all the way to page 50, where I discovered that the POST request was made to IP "96.126.101.6."

> I then had to determine the name of a malicious executable (EXE) that the actor had dropped. To figure this out, I just navigated through the report and saw that the executable was "G_jugk.exe" under the
PID 1640.

> I then had to determine how many vendors believed the host was malicious by reviewing a report from Virustotal. To figure this out, I just clicked on the link that kept the report and saw that a total
of 9 vendors determined the host to be malicious.

*** Tools ***

> Moving on to this section, I had to answer a question that asked me to provide the alternate name for fuzzy hashes without the abbreviation. To figure this out, I went to the "SSDeep" official webpage,
navigated around and saw the alternate name to be "context-triggered piecewise hashes."

*** TTPs ***

> I then had to answer a few questions within this section. The first one, I had to figure out how many techniques fall under the Exfiltration category. To figure this out, I had to navigate to the
ATT&CK Matrix webpage, scroll around, and I discovered that there were a total of 9 techniques under the Exfiltration category.

> For the last question, I had to determine the name of the commercial remote access tool, Chimera, used for C2 beacons and data exfiltration. To figure this out, I navigated to the website
"MITRE ATT&CK Matrix," I scrolled through and saw that the Chimera used "Cobalt Strike" as its remote access tool.

## Reflection

> This lab provided me with knowledge about the pyramid of pain and how to utilize this model to determine the level of difficulty it will cause for an adversary to change the indicators associated with
them, and their campaign.
