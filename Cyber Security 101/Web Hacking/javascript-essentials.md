*** JavaScript Overview ***

> After launching the THM Machine i then was given a small practical to create a program in JS within the Google Chrome application console. I had to figure out the value of two added numbers by using a specific code
that was provided. To do this i launched the Google Chrome application, then right-clicked and selected "inspect."

> I then selected the "console" tab, copied the code that was provided and pasted it within the console then clicked enter. I got the result of "15."

> I then had to change the value of x to 10 to figure out the new result. After copy and pasting the same code within the console i changed the value of x to 10, then clicked enter and got the result of 20.

*** Integrating JavaScript in HTML ***

> I was then given an exercise to create an HTML document with internal JS. To do this i right-clicked on the desktop, then selected "Create Document," then "Empty File."

> I then renmaed the created document to "internal.html."

> I then had to add some code to the "internal.html" file by opening it with Pulma, then copying and pasting the code into the text editor.

> <img width="482" height="554" alt="java6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e43ca5-c363-449b-bbcb-6497874ee9a0" />

> I then saved the code within within the "internal.html" file, closed the text editor then double clicked on the file to open it up in Google Chrome. Opening the file within Google Chrome gave me the result of
the task i was looking to perform. Which was to add (x and y) and then display the results on the web page. The result was "15."

> For my next task i had to perform external JS. To do this i had to first create a separate .js file and store JS code within the file. So after creating the .js file on the desktop and renaming the file to
"script.js" i then added the code for the same task i did within the "internal.html" to the "script.js" file, saved it, and closed the text editor.

> I then had to create another "html" file on the desktop. After renaming the file to "external.html," i opened it with Pulma and added the same code from the "internal.html" file, saved it and closed the text
editor.

> After double clicking on the "external.html" file and opening it in Google Chrome i got the same result as the "internal.html" file which was "15."

> I then was given another exercise on how to verify whether a website uses internal or external JS. I was given an "external_test.html" file within the "exercise" folder on the Desktop.

> <img width="554" height="299" alt="java14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/191e051e-fe7a-4779-b2c1-4e1e525d2162" />

> To check whether this html file used internal or external JS i had to double click on the file to open it in Google Chrome, then right-click, select "View page source," and this presented that the website
used external JS.

*** Abusing Dialouge Functions ***

> I was then given a few exercises within the Abusing Dialouge Functions section. My first task was to get Google Chrome to display the alert "Hello THM." To do this i first launched Google Chrome, then opened
the console tab and inputted the code "alert("Hello THM")," then pressed "enter."

> For the next exercise i had to get Google Chrome to display the prompt "What is your name?" To do this i first lauched Google Chrome, then opened the console tab and inputted the code
"name = prompt("What is your name?");," followed by " alert("Hello " + name);," then pressed "enter."

> <img width="1081" height="774" alt="java20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76811a8f-a5b1-48d1-a9c1-1e9851165f20" />

> After entering my name within the prompt i pressed the "ok" button and got the alert "Hello Makonenn."

> For the next exercise i had to get Google Chrome to display the confirm dialouge "Do you want to proceed?" To do this i inputted the code "confirm("Do you want to proceed?")," then pressed "enter."

> <img width="1010" height="657" alt="java22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829f7f20-a5b9-474c-9ccd-fd658a3fe00a" />

> After pressing the "ok" button on the confirm dialouge i got the message "true."
