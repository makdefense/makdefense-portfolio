*** Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge) ***

> After launching the THM Machine, I was given a task to do an IDOR challenge under the Broken Access Control section. I had to find a flag that was within the other users' notes. To do this i first
opened "Mozilla FireFox" and went to the website "http://10.201.106.172" and used the login credentials of the username "noot" and password "test1234."

> Then to find the flag i just went to the searchbar in Mozilla FireFox and changed the website from "http://10.201.106.172/note.php?note_id=1" to "http://10.201.106.172/note.php?note_id=0" and it
