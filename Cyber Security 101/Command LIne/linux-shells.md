## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of interacting with a Shell, as it enables me to have control, speed, flexibility, and is often the only option available when managing or securing systems. Next, I learned
about the importance of knowing about the types of Linux Shells, which is that it helps to write better scripts, debug faster, work more efficiently, and avoid compatibility or security issues. Lastly, I learned the
importance of knowing about Shell scripting and components, which makes you a powerful, efficient, and valuable tech professional. It unlocks automation, boosts productivity, and sharpens your system understanding.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, I then launched Linux's terminal and I logged in to the interface using SSH with the credentials "user" for the Username, "user@Tryhackme" for the password,
and the IP address "10.201.40.223." I then input the command "pwd" and pressed the "enter" button to check the working directory, which then displayed "/home/user." I then input the command
"ls" and then the "enter" button to list the contents of that working directory, and displayed "flag_hunt.sh." I then input "cat flag_hunt.sh" and then pressed the enter button to display the contents of the file.
> 
> Next, I decided to run a new command that displays the type of Shell that is currently being used for the operating system, so I input "echo $SHELL," then the "enter" button, and "/bin/bash" was displayed
afterwards. I then wanted to figure out the list of all available Shells that were in the system, so I inputted "cat /etc/shells," then "enter," and the list of every Shell in the Linux OS was displayed.
I then input the command "zsh," then pressed Enter to switch to the "zsh" Shell in the OS.
> 
Following this, I created a Script file within the bash Shell using the command "nano" and named it "first_script.sh ". Next, within the script file, I input "!#/bin/bash", which is
known as "shebang", to start writing my script within the Script file. I then input a set of variables and commands for the script, which included "echo 'Hey, what's your name'?," followed by "read name,"
and finally "echo 'Welcome, $name." What this script does is that it displays on the screen "Hey, what's your name?" first then it takes input from the user using the "read" command where "name" is where
the variable will be stored, then finally "echo" executes "Welcome" and the name that the user provided at the "read" command. I then pressed "control+X" to exit and "Y," then pressed the enter button to save the
command. Next, I decided to try the script by inputting "chmod +x first_script.sh," then pressing the "enter" button to give execution permission to the script, and then typing "./first_script.sh" to execute.
>
Afterwards, I created a loop file by typing "nano loop_script.sh" and pressing the "enter" button. Next, I input "#!/bin/bash" to start the script, then the "enter" button, then "for i in {1..10}" to set the "i"
variable to iterate the numbers 1 through 10 when the script is executed, then "do" to indicate the start of the loop script, then "echo $i" to display the variable's value for every iteration, then finally "done" which
will indicate the end of the loop script. I then saved the loop script by pressing "control+X" and then "Y," and finally pressing the enter button. Afterwards, I gave the script a go by inputting "chmod +x loop_script.sh,"
pressing the "enter" button, then inputting "./loop_script.sh," then pressing the "enter" button, which iterated the numbers 1 through 10. Next, I implemented conditional statements by first creating a new file called
"conditional_script.sh" by inputting "nano conditional_script.sh," then pressing the "enter" button. Then, within the script file, I input "#!/bin/bash," then pressed the "enter" button to start writing a script that took a user's
name and stored it into a variable. So on the first line of the script I inputted 'echo "Please enter your name first:'," then "read name" on the second line, then "if [ "$name" = "Makonenn" ]; then" on the third, then on the
fourth line "echo 'Welcome Makonenn! Here is the secret: THM_Script'," then "else" on the fifth, then on the sixth line "echo 'Sorry! You are not authorized to access the secret.'," and finally "fi" on the last line of the script.
To save and close out the script i pressed "control+X," then Y to save the script. Next i inputted "chmod +x conditional_script.sh," then pressed "enter" button to implement execution permissions to the conditional statment. Then
gave the script a go by inputting "./conditional_script.sh," then pressing "enter" button. I then added comments into the script of the conditional statement by inputting "nano conditional_script.sh," entered the comments so that
the code can be comprehended by others easily since the code is lengthy.
> 
After performing various Shell Scripting tasks, I created a "Locker Script" to secure the locker for a bank, which will only open after a user has verified themselves. I inputted "nano locker_script.sh,"
to create the file, then pressed "enter." Next to start writing the script, I input "!#/bin/bash," then code that defines the variables, defines the loop, defines the conditional statements, and finally code that checks if the
user entered the correct details. To exit and saved the script for the script file i pressed "control+x," and then pressed "Y." I then gave the locker script a go by first executing the permissions to run it by inputting
"chmod +x locker_script.sh," then pressed "enter" button, then "./loop_script.sh," then pressed "enter" button, and finally inputted the variables the generate the pin for the locker.
> 
> Lastly, I completed a practical exercise which was to make changes to the code inside of a given script file called "flag_hunt.sh," to find a specific file that has the ".log" extension, and to find out where the cat was
sleeping. To do this, I first had to become the root user by inputting "sudo su," then pressing "enter," then inputting the password "user@Tryhackme." Then I had to get into nano mode to edit the script file "flag_hunt.sh", so I
first inputted "nano flag_hunt.sh," then pressed the "enter" button. What was displayed was the script, but there were missing variables in some of the code. For the # defining the directory to search our flag code "directory=" i
had to fill in the variable as "/var/log/," for the # defining the flag to search code "flag," i had to fill in the variable as "thm-flag01-script," and for the # defining for loop to iterate over all the files with .log extension
in define directory code "for file in "" /*.log; do" i had to fill in the variable as "/var/log." After adjusting the code, I saved and exited nano mode by pressing "control+x" and pressing "enter". I then gave permissions to
execute the script by typing "chmod +x flag_hunt.sh," then pressing the "enter" button. Then I input "./flag_hunt." to run the script, which then searched the "/var/log" directory for the ".log" file that contained the flag. What
was displayed was "Flag found in: authentication.log." I then pressed "enter," then changed the directory by inputting "cd /var/log," then "ls" to list the contents of the directory, and found the "authentication.log" file within
the directory. To then find out where the cat was sleeping, I inputted "cat /var/log/authentication.log," then "enter." What was then displayed was "the cat is sleeping under the table."
