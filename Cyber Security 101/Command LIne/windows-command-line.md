## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, i established an SSH connection with the IP "10.10.93.24," by logging in with the SSH client "user" and with the password "Tryhackme123!". Next i went ahead
and checked the OS version by inputting the command "ver," which then displayed "Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.2655]." I then proceeded to check more in-depth information about the system
by inputting the command "systeminfo." Next i inputted "cls" to clear everything up and then inputted "ipconfig" to figure out the subnet mask which was "255.255.0.0." Then to figure out the MAC
address i inputted "ipcong /all" which displayed physical address as "02-14-A0-37-BC-B3." Moved on to figuring out the name of the process listening on port 3389 by inputting "netstat -abon",
which displayed "TermService".
