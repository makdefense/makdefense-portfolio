## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, i connected to the VM via SSH using the Remmina client by entering the IP address "10.10.8.156" into the bar at the top of the Remmina client then clicking enter. Next
i signed into the client with the creditianls of "captain" for the username and "JollyR0ger#" for the password. I then launched PowerShell by using the target VM's command prompt by typing "powershell"
and clicking enter. Next i figured out how to retrieve a list of commands that start with the verb "Remove" by inputting the commmand "Get-Command -Name "Remove*"" into PowerShell. I then inputted the
command "Get-Alias" to list all aliases available to find the alias with the counterpart of "echo" which was the command "Write-Output." Following i then figured out the command to retrieve some example usage
for the cmdlet "New-LocalUser" by using the "Get-Help" command which provides detailed information about cmdlets. The entire command i inputted to display it was "Get-Help New-LocalUser -examples."
> Next i practiced navigating through the system with powershell using command "Get-ChildItem," i specifically used that command to display the contents of the "C:\Users" directory by inputting "Get-ChildItem
-Path C:\Users" and clicking enter. What was displayed was 4 users for that specific directory. I then learned how to work with files, specifically i selected the user "captain" by typing "Get-ChildItem, which listed
all the folders for that user. I then selected the specific file titled "Documents" by typing "Set-Location -Path ".\Documents"." I then created a new item (directory) called "captain-wardrobe in the document folder by typing
"New-Item -Path ".\captain-cabin\captain-wardrobe" -ItemType "Directory"." Next i created a file within that directory called "captain-boots.txt" by typing
"New-Item -Path ".\captain-cabin\captain-wardrobe\captain-boots.txt" -ItemType "File"." I then copied one directory and moved it to another directory by typing
"Copy-Item -Path .\captain-cabin\captain-hat.txt -Destination .\captain-cabin\captain-hat2.txt and clicking enter. Followed by typing "Get-ChildItem -Path ".captain-cabin\"." To display what was moved to that directory.
Next i then selected that directory by typing "Set-Location -Path .\captain-cabin" then clicked enter, followed by typing Get-Content -Path ".\captain-hat.txt" to display the contents of the .txt file.
> Next i practiced piping, filtering, and sorting data within specific child directories. I figured out how to retrieve the items in the directory "captain-cabin" with a greater size that 100 by inputting the
script "Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property "Length" -gt "100"." This displayed 3 items.
> I was then tasked with figuring out a hidden flag within a hidden user's directories. First i had to identify the hidden user by inputting "Get-LocalUser" and clicking enter which displayed 6 items and out of the 6
was the hidden user called "p1r4t3." After figuring out the hidden user i then figured out all of his child directories by inputting "Get-ChildItem -Path ".\p1r4t3"." and clicking enter which display a directory
called "hidden-treasure-chest." Upon discovering that directory i then selected the directory by inputting "Set-Location -Path ".\hidden-treasure-chest" and clicking enter, then inputting "Get-ChildItem" and clicking enter to
display the files that were in that directory. The file that was in the directory was "big-treasure.txt," and to display the hidden flag i inputted "Get-Content -Path ".\big-treasure-chest.txt" and clicked enter. The flag
"THM{p34rlInAsh3ll}" was displayed.
> I then wanted to figure out the hash of the flag that i discovered so i inputted "Get-FileHash -Path .\big-treasure.txt" and clicked enter which then generate the hash "71FC5EC11C2497A32F8F08E61399687D90ABE6E204D2964DF589543A613F3E08."
I then was tasked to find a modified display name of a service which was done by the hidden user "p1r4t3." To do this i first inputted "Set-Location -Path ".\captain"." to select it to the "captain" directory then after clicking enter
i inputted "Get-Service" then clicked enter and scrolled down to find the motto of the hidden user "p1r4t3" and found that the service was "p1r4t3-s-compass" that had a modified display name.
