## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, i connected to the VM via SSH using the Remmina client by entering the IP address "10.10.8.156" into the bar at the top of the Remmina client then clicking enter. Next
i signed into the client with the creditianls of "captain" for the username and "JollyR0ger#" for the password. I then launched PowerShell by using the target VM's command prompt by typing "powershell"
and clicking enter. Next i figured out how to retrieve a list of commands that start with the verb "Remove" by inputting the commmand "Get-Command -Name "Remove*"" into PowerShell. I then inputted the
command "Get-Alias" to list all aliases available to find the alias with the counterpart of "echo" which was the command "Write-Output." Following i then figured out the command to retrieve some example usage
for the cmdlet "New-LocalUser" by using the "Get-Help" command which provides detailed information about cmdlets. The entire command i inputted to display it was "Get-Help New-LocalUser -examples."
> Next i practiced navigating through the system with powershell using command "Get-ChildItem," i specifically used that command to display the contents of the "C:\Users" directory by inputting "Get-ChildItem
-Path C:\Users" and clicking enter. What was displayed was 4 users for that specific directory. I then learned how to work with files, specifically i selected the user "captain" by typing "Get-ChildItem, which listed
all the folders for that user. I then selected the specific file titled "Documents" by typing "Set-Location -Path ".\Documents"." I then created a new item (directory) called "captain-wardrobe in the document folder by typing
"New-Item -Path ".\captain-cabin\captain-wardrobe" -ItemType "Directory"." Next i created a file within that directory called "captain-boots.txt" by typing
"New-Item -Path ".\captain-cabin\captain-wardrobe\captain-boots.txt" -ItemType "File"." I then copied one directory and moved it to another directory by typing
"Copy-Item -Path .\captain-cabin\captain-hat.txt -Destination .\captain-cabin\captain-hat2.txt and clicking enter. Followed by typing "Get-ChildItem -Path ".captain-cabin\"." To display what was moved to that directory.
Next i then selected that directory by typing "Set-Location -Path .\captain-cabin" then clicked enter, followed by typing Get-Content -Path ".\captain-hat.txt" to display the contents of the .txt file.
> Next i practiced piping, filtering, and sorting data within specific child directories.
