## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, i connected to the VM via SSH using the Remmina client by entering the IP address "10.10.8.156" into the bar at the top of the Remmina client then clicking enter. Next
i signed into the client with the creditianls of "captain" for the username and "JollyR0ger#" for the password. I then launched PowerShell by using the target VM's command prompt by typing "powershell"
and clicking enter. Next i figured out how to retrieve a list of commands that start with the verb "Remove" by inputting the commmand "Get-Command -Name "Remove*"" into PowerShell. I then inputted the
command "Get-Alias" to list all aliases available to find the alias with the counterpart of "echo" which was the command "Write-Output." Following i then figured out the command to retrieve some example usage
for the cmdlet "New-LocalUser" by using the "Get-Help" command which provides detailed information about cmdlets. The entire command i inputted to display it was "Get-Help New-LocalUser -examples."
> Next i practiced navigating through the system with powershell using command "Get-ChildItem," i specifically used that command to display the content of the "C:\Users" directory by inputting "Get-ChildItem
-Path C:\Users" and clicking enter. What was displayed was 4 items for that specific directory.
