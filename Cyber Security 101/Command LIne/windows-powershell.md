## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding PowerShell basics, which is essential if you want to automate tasks, investigate threats, or effectively defend Windows environments.
Next, I learned about the importance of being able to navigate the file system and work with files in PowerShell, which is essential because files are where evidence lives, malware hides, and
automation thrives. The importance of learning about Piping, Filtering, and Sorting Data in PowerShell is that it enables you to process, clean, and analyze large datasets quickly, clearly, and with precision.
I then learned the importance of knowing your system and network information in PowerShell, which is that it gives you real-time control over your environment, sharpens your troubleshooting, boosts your security
awareness, and prepares you to defend against or respond to cyber threats. The importance of learning Real-Time System Analysis gives you the power to detect, investigate, and respond to threats as they happen.
Finally, the importance of learning about scripting in PowerShell lies in its ability to provide leverage in CyberSecurity, from automating tasks and managing systems to detecting threats and responding quickly.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, I connected to the VM via SSH using the Remmina client by entering the IP address "10.10.8.156" into the top bar of the Remmina client and then clicking Enter. Next,
I signed in to the client with the credentials "captain" for the username and "JollyR0ger#" for the password. I then launched PowerShell by using the target VM's command prompt by typing "powershell"
and clicking enter. Next, I figured out how to retrieve a list of commands that start with the verb "Remove" by inputting the command "Get-Command -Name 'Remove*'" into PowerShell. I then input the
command "Get-Alias" to list all aliases available to find the alias with the counterpart of "echo," which was the command "Write-Output." Following this, I then figured out the command to retrieve some example usage
for the cmdlet "New-LocalUser" by using the "Get-Help" command, which provides detailed information about cmdlets. The entire command I inputted to display it was "Get-Help New-LocalUser -examples."
> Next, I practiced navigating through the system with PowerShell using the command "Get-ChildItem." I specifically used that command to display the contents of the "C:\Users" directory by inputting "Get-ChildItem
-Path C:\Users" and clicking enter. What was displayed was four users for that specific directory. I then learned how to work with files, specifically, I selected the user "captain" by typing "Get-ChildItem, which listed
all the folders for that user. I then selected the specific file titled "Documents" by typing "Set-Location -Path '.\Documents'." I then created a new item (directory) called "captain-wardrobe in the document folder by typing
"New-Item -Path ".\captain-cabin\captain-wardrobe" -ItemType 'Directory'." Next, I created a file within that directory called "captain-boots.txt" by typing
"New-Item -Path ".\captain-cabin\captain-wardrobe\captain-boots.txt" -ItemType "File"." I then copied one directory and moved it to another directory by typing
"Copy-Item -Path .\captain-cabin\captain-hat.txt -Destination .\captain-cabin\captain-hat2.txt and clicking enter. Followed by typing "Get-ChildItem -Path ".captain-cabin\"." To display what was moved to that directory.
Next, I then selected that directory by typing "Set-Location -Path .\captain-cabin" then clicked enter, followed by typing Get-Content -Path ".\captain-hat.txt" to display the contents of the .txt file.
> Next, I practiced piping, filtering, and sorting data within specific child directories. I figured out how to retrieve the items in the directory "captain-cabin" with a size greater than 100 by inputting the
script "Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property "Length" -gt "100"." This displayed three items.
> I was then tasked with figuring out a hidden flag within a hidden user's directories. First, I had to identify the hidden user by inputting "Get-LocalUser" and clicking enter, which displayed six items, and out of the 6
was the hidden user called "p1r4t3" After figuring out the hidden user i then figured out all of his child directories by inputting "Get-ChildItem -Path ".\p1r4t3"." and clicking enter which display a directory
called "hidden-treasure-chest." Upon discovering that directory i then selected the directory by inputting "Set-Location -Path ".\hidden-treasure-chest" and clicking enter, then inputting "Get-ChildItem" and clicking enter to
display the files that were in that directory. The file that was in the directory was "big-treasure.txt," and to display the hidden flag i inputted "Get-Content -Path ".\big-treasure-chest.txt" and clicked enter. The flag
"THM{p34rlInAsh3ll}" was displayed.
> I then wanted to determine the hash of the flag I had discovered, so I entered "Get-FileHash -Path .\big-treasure.txt" and pressed Enter, which generated the hash "71FC5EC11C2497A32F8F08E61399687D90ABE6E204D2964DF589543A613F3E08."
> I was then tasked with finding a modified display name for a service, which was done by the hidden user "p1r4t3." To do this, I first input "Set-Location -Path ".\captain"." to select it to the "captain" directory, then after clicking enter
I typed "Get-Service" and then clicked Enter, scrolling down to find the motto of the hidden user "p1r4t3". I discovered that the service was "p1r4t3-s-compass" and had a modified display name.
> Finally, I learned about the Invoke-Command command and how to list examples of its use in PowerShell by inputting "Get-Help Invoke-Command -examples" and pressing Enter.
