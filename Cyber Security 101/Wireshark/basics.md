## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding the basics of using Wireshark, which is a widely used tool for network packet analysis, and knowing how to use it can make you far more
effective in cybersecurity, networking, and troubleshooting. The importance of learning about Packet Dissection is that it is like reading an autopsy report for network traffic - it tells you exactly what happened,
without relying on assumptions, and that skill makes you far more effective in both prevention and investigation. Next, I learn about the importance of understanding Packet Navigation, which is like knowing how to
use the "search and map" features in Google Maps - without it, you wander around. With it, you can get from raw capture to clear answers quickly. Finally, I learned the importance of understanding
packet filtering, which is that it turns a chaotic ocean of network data into a clear, targeted view - without it, finding useful information is slow, frustrating, and often impossible.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, I was then given a practical to figure out some details for a "pcapng" file. The file name given was "Exercise.pcapng," I had to figure out the file's comments, the total number of
packets, and the SHA256 hash value. To do this, I first launched Wireshark, then clicked on the "File" tab on top, then "Open," then selected the "Exercise.pcapng" file, then pressed the "Open" button again.
After opening the file, I clicked the "Statistics" tab at the top and then pressed "Capture File Properties." This opened up the file's properties, which included everything from file details to comments.
I then scrolled down within the "Capture file comments" box to find the hidden flag, which was "TryHackMe_Wireshark_Demo." I then scrolled within the "Details" box to find the total packets captured for
the pcapng file, which was under the "Statistics" header. The total packet amount given was "58620." I then had to find the value for the SHA256 hash. I did this by scrolling up within the "Details" box and
finding it under the "File" header. The value given was "f446de335565fb0b0ee5e5a3266703c778b2f3dfad7efeaeccb2da5641a6d6eb." Next, I had to carry out a packet dissection by investigating packet 38 of the
"exercise.pcapng" file for specific details. I first had to figure out the type of "markup language" that was used under the HTTP protocol. I did this by first selecting packet number 38, then going to the
bottom left box for "packet details," and saw that the type of markup language was "eXtensible Markup Language." Next, I looked for the arrival date of the packet. I did this by clicking the dropdown of
"HyperText Transfer Protocol" within the packet details box, and saw the arrival date was "Thu, 13 May 2004." I then looked for the "TTL value," which is worded out as "Time to live." I did this by clicking
the dropdown of "Internet Protocols Version 4" within the packet details box, and saw the "TTL value" was "47." Following this, I had to find the TCP payload size of the packet. I did this by clicking the dropdown
of the "Transmission Control Protocol" within the packet details box and saw the payload size was "424." Then, figuring out the "e-tag value," I had to click again on the dropdown of the "HyperText Transfer Protocol"
within the packet detail box, I saw the value was "9a01a-4696-7e354b00."
> I was then given another practical to find the name of "artist 1" within a packet's details. To do this, I first search for the "r4w" string by clicking the "edit" tab at the top of the screen, selecting "find
packet," and in the search bar selecting "string" as the search option, then inputting the "r4w" value. I then went to the bottom left box to search through the HTML code to find the first artist name, which was
"r4w8173." Next, I had to get the MD5 hash for packet 12. I did this by clicking the "Go" at the top of the application, then "Go to Packet," then searching for packet 12." I then selected "packet comment" that was
in the detail box in the botton left, then saw i had to go to packet "39765" to get the MD5 hash, so i clicked the "Go" at the top again, then the dropdown "Go to Packet," and inputted "39765," i then right-clicked
on "JPEG File Interchange Format," then clicked on "Export Packet Bytes," and saved the file as "answer." I then right-clicked on the "answer" file, which was saved on the Desktop, and clicked on "properties," then
left-clicked to "digests," selected "MD5," clicked the "hash" button, and got the value of "911cd574a42865a956ccde2d04495ebf." Next, I had to find an alien's name within the capture file. To do this, I
clicked "File" at the top, then "Export Objects," then selected "HTTP," then within the "Text Filter" bar I input "txt" to narrow the files down to txt files. I then selected the "txt" file and saved it to
the Desktop. I then opened the "note.txt" file and scrolled to find the alien's name, which was "packetmaster." I then had to find the number of warnings for the capture file. To do this, I clicked the "Analyze" at
the top, then clicked "Expert Information," and saw that the total warnings labelled in yellow were "1636."
> Moving on, I had to implement packet filtering in the next practical. I had to figure out a filter query for packet number 4. To do this, I first clicked the "Go" tab at the top of the application, then "Go
To Packet," I then inputted "4" to go to that specific packet. I then went to the bottom left corner and right-clicked on "Hypertext Transfer Protocol," then clicked "Apply as Filter," then "Selected," and saw
that the filter query was "http" in the filter pane. I also had to figure out the number of packets for HTTP, which was "1089" when I looked down at the bottom right corner. I then had to look for the total number of
artists within packet number "33790" HTTP stream. I did this by clicking the "Go" tab at the top of the application, then selecting "Go to Packet," and then entering "33790" to go to that specific packet. I then went to the bottom left corner and right-clicked on "Hypertext Transfer Protocol," then "Follow," then "HTTP Stream." This then brought up HTML code where I had to scroll through to find both the second artist's
name and the total number of artists. The total number of artists was 3, and the name of the second artist was "Blad3."
