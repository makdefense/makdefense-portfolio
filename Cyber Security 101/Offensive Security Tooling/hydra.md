## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding Hydra, which is a widely used tool that teaches you how attackers perform credential-based attacks, and knowing it helps you
identify, test, and defend against those attacks responsibly.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- [ ] Learn about and how to use Hydra

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

*** Using Hydra ***

> After launching the THM Machine and reading through the Hydra Intro and Using Hydra sections, I was given a practical to use Hydra to brute-force Molly's web password to capture a flag. To go about this,
I first launched the website given for the Hydra Challenge, which was "http://10.201.114.151"

> Next, I went back to the Linux terminal and input the following command to brute-force Molly's web password
"hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.201.114.151 http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Your username or password is incorrect."
then pressed "enter," which retrieved the web password "sunshine" for Molly.

> I then went back to the Hydra Challenge website on Mozilla Firefox and used the login credentials to log in to the user "molly," and retrieved the flag "THM{2673a7dd116de68e85c48ec0b1f2612e}."

> I was then given another exercise to brute-force Molly's SSH password to retrieve another flag. To do this, I opened the Linux terminal and ran the following command
"hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.201.114.151 -t 4 ssh"
then, I pressed "enter," which retrieved the SSH password "butterfly" for Molly.

> After retrieving the SSH login credentials for Molly, I stayed in the Linux terminal and inputted the command "ssh molly@10.201.114.151," pressed "enter," inputted "yes," and was logged in as Molly
via SSH.

> I then entered the command "ls" followed by "enter" to list all files and directories within the user "molly," and saw the "flag2.txt" file. So I then input "cat flag2.txt," pressed "enter," and
retrieved the flag "THM{c8eeb0468febbadea859baeb33b2541b}."

## Reflection

> This lab provided me with knowledge about Hydra and how to use it by bruteforcing a user's SSH and Web password.
