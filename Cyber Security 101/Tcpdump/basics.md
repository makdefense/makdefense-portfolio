## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding TCPdump basics, which is that it is like the "microscope" for your network - learning to use it lets you see what's happening under the
hood, which is essential for any network engineer, sysadmin, or cybersecurity professional. Next, I learned about the importance of understanding basic packet capture in tcpdump, which is that it is a
fundamental skill that empowers you to see and analyze the exact data moving through a network, making you more effective in troubleshooting, securing, and understanding networks. Following, I learned the importance
of understanding filtering expressions in tcpdump, which is that you will be able to capture exactly what you need, ignore what you don't, and analyze network traffic faster and smarter. I then learned about the
importance of knowing about advanced filtering in tcpdump, which is that if mastered, you can become a surgical network analyst - cutting through noise with laser-focused captures, improving your troubleshooting
speed, security insight, and overall network visibility. Finally, I learned the importance of understanding how to display packets, which is that it transforms raw network captures into clear, actionable insights -
making you a more effective troubleshooter and analyst.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching THM's Virtual Machine, I read the introduction to Tcpdump: The basics, and started the first exercise I was given. I had to find out how many packets were in the file "traffic.pcap"
To use the ICMP protocol, I entered the command "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap icmp" and then pressed the Enter button. I was then given a long list of data, so to condense it, I entered "tcpdumb -r traffic.pcap
icmp | wc," then pressed the "enter" button. I added "| wc" to pipe the data down into a single line of information and get the total word count for the data. After doing this, I got 
26 for the total number of packets. Next, I had to figure out the IP address of the host that asked for the MAC address of "192.168.124.137." To do this, I input "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap -nn arp," then pressed
enter. This then displayed the IP address of "192.168.124.148." Following, I had to figure out the hostname (subdomain) that appears in the first DNS query, to do this, I inputted "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap port 53,"
I added port 53 to the command because that's the port where DNS happens.
> I then had to figure out how many packets were in the TCP Reset (RST) flag set. I did this by inputting the command "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap 'tcp[tcpflags] == tcp-rst' | wc," then pressing "enter." I add the "| wc"
to condense the data because there was too much data given without using the "| wc" command. The total number of packets given was 57. Next, I had to figure out the IP address of the host that sent packets larger
than Fifteen thousand bytes. I did this by inputting "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap greater 15000 -n," then pressing the "enter" button. What was displayed was the IP address "185.117.80.53"
> Finally, I had to figure out the MAC address of the host that sent an ARP request with the traffic.pcap file, to do this I inputted "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap arp -e," then pressed "enter."
The MAC address displayed is "52:54:00:7c:d3:5b." I added the command "-e" at the end of the script because this command is used to include the MAC address when displaying packets.
