## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching THM's Virtual Machine, i read the introduction to Tcpdump: The basics and wen on to start the first exercise i was given. I had to find out how many packets were in the file "traffic.pcap"
using the ICMP protocol, to do this i entered the command "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap icmp," then pressed enter button. I was then given a long list of data so to condense it i entered "tcpdumb -r traffic.pcap
icmp | wc," then pressed the "enter" button. The reason why i added "| wc" was to pipe the data down into a single line of information and just get the total word count for the data. After doing this i got 
26 for the total number of packets. Next i had to figure out the IP address of the host that asked for the MAC address of "192.168.124.137," to do this i inputted "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap -nn arp," then pressed
enter. This then displayed the IP address of "192.168.124.148." Following i had to figure out the hostname (subdomain) that appears in the first DNS query, to do this i inputted "tcpdump -r traffic.pcap port 53,"
i added port 53 to the command because that's the port where DNS happens.
