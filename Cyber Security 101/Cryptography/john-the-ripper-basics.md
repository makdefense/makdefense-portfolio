> After launching the Virtual Machine: Crypto - JTR v04, I first read through "Cracking Basic Hashes" section, then went along to start the first practical, for the first practical i had to determine the type of
hash of the file "hash1.txt." To do this i navigated to the directory "Task04" by inputting "ls," then pressing "enter" to see all the directories, then I inputted "cd John-the-Ripper-The-Basics," then pressed
"enter," then inputted "cd Task04," and pressed "enter" to fully get into the directory "Task04." From there i inputted "ls" to list all the files that were in that directory and saw the "hash1.txt" file, i then
inputted "cat hash1.txt" to display the contents of the file which was the hash value of "2e728dd31fb5949bc39cac5a9f066498." After discovering the hash value for the file i then launched the python tool to identify
the specific type of hash, i inputted "python3 hash-id.py," then pressed "enter," then copied and pasted the hash: "2e728dd31fb5949bc39cac5a9f066498," then pressed "enter" and got the hash type of "MD5."

> Next i had to figure out the cracked value of the "hash1.txt" file, i did this by inputting "john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash1.txt," then pressing "enter." This then
displayed "biscuit" as the cracked value of "hash1.txt."

> I then had to figure out the hash type of "hash2.txt." I did this by inputting "cat hash2.txt," then pressing "enter" to get the full hash value which was "1A732667F3917C0F4AA98BB13011B9090C6F8065," i then
inputted "python3 hash-id.py," then pressed "enter," then copied and pasted the hash: "1A732667F3917C0F4AA98BB13011B9090C6F8065," then pressed "enter" and got the hash type of "SHA-1."

> Next i had to figure out the cracked value of "hash2.txt" file, i did this by inputting "john --format=Raw-SHA1 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash2.txt," then pressing "enter." This then
displayed "kangeroo" as the cracked value of "hash2.txt."

> Next i had to figure out the hash type of "hash3.txt." I did this by inputting "cat hash3.txt," then pressing "enter" to get the full hash value which was
"D7F4D3CCEE7ACD3DD7FAD3AC2BE2AAE9C44F4E9B7FB802D73136D4C53920140A," i then inputted "python3 hash-id.py," then pressed "enter," then copied and pasted the hash:
"D7F4D3CCEE7ACD3DD7FAD3AC2BE2AAE9C44F4E9B7FB802D73136D4C53920140A," then pressed "enter" and got the hash type of "SHA-256."

> I then had to figure out the crack value of "hash3.txt" file, i did this by inputting "john --format=Raw-SHA256 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash3.txt," then pressing "enter." This then displayed
"microphone" as the cracked value of "hash3.txt."

> Finally for the Cracking Basic Hashes practical, i did the same steps i did for hash1.txt, hash2.txt, and hash3.txt for hash4.txt and got the hash type: "whirlpool" and cracked value: "colossal."

> Following, i was given a Cracking Windows Authentication Hashes practical, i had to first figure out the format in order to crack the hash value of the file: "ntlm.txt." So first i had to navigate to the directory
in which the file was in so i inputted "cd Task05," then pressed "enter," the "ls" to see if the file was actually in the directory in which it was. I then inputted "john --list=formats | grep -iF "NT" to see
if the format was "NT" to crack the file's hash of "5460C85BD858A11475115D2DD3A82333," and it was.

> Next i had to find the cracked value of the password file "ntml.txt." To do this i inputted "john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ntlm.txt," then pressed "enter," and was given the
cracked value of "mushroom."

> I was then given a practical to crack a /etc/shadow Hash. I had to try and crack the password hash of the root user provided in the "etchashes.txt" file which was located in directory "Task06." To do this
i first inputted "cd Task06," to navigate to the directory, then inputted the command "unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > etchashes.txt," which combines /etc/shadow passwords with the /etc/passwd file so
JTR can understand the data that needs to be cracked. Next i inputted the command used for cracking the output that I fed to JTR using unshadowing which was
"john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt etchashes.txt," then pressed "enter" button to load the password hash which was "1234."

> Next, I was given a practical to use John's Single Crack Mode to access a hash and crack it in directory "/John-the-Ripper-The-Basics/Task07/," i had to assume the password belonged to the user "Joker." To do this
i first navigated to the directory where the "hash07.txt" file was in by inputting "cd John-the-Ripper-The-Basics," then "enter," then "cd Task07," then "enter" again. I then inputted "ls" to list all files and saw
the "hash07.txt" file. Next i inputted "cat hash07.txt," then "enter" to display the file's hash which was "7bf6d9bb82bed1302f331fc6b816aada," then inputted "nano hash07.txt," then "enter" to edit the file's hash
by adding "joker:" because i had to assume the hash belonged to the user "Joker." After exiting nano mode i then inputted "cat hash07.txt" to make sure that the file displayed "joker:7bf6d9bb82bed1302f331fc6b816aada,"
and it did. So i then proceed with John's single crack mode by inputting "john --single --format=raw-md5 hash07.txt," then "enter" which displayed the cracked hash "Jok3r."
