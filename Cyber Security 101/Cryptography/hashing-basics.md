## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

> After launching AttackBox, I read the introduction to Hashing Basics, then was given the first practical to find the SHA256 hash of the "passport.jpg" file in directory "~/Hashing-Basics/Task-2." To do
this i inputted "ls," to list all the working directories, then pressed "enter" button, Next i changed directories by inputting "cd home/user/Hashing-Basics," after changing to the directory i then inputted
"ls" to list the directories that were in the "Hashing-Basics" directory and what i saw was some other directories which included "Task-2." I then inputted "cd Task-2," then "enter" button to switch to that
directory. Next, i inputted "ls" to list the contents of "Task-2" directory and saw the "passport.jpg" file that we had to find the hash value for. So to find "passport.jpg" SHA256 hash i inputted "SHA256
sum passport.jpg," then pressed "enter," and was given the hash value: "77148c6f605a8df855f2b764bcc3be749d7db814f5f79134d2aa539a64b61f02."
