> I then was give a practical to do at the end of the room. I had to use GPG to decrypt the message that was in "~/Public-Crypto-Basics/Task-7" and retrieve the secret word To do this, I first had to change
directories to up to "Task-7," so first i inputted "cd /home/user/Public-Crypto-Basics," pressed "enter," then inputted "cd Task-7," then pressed "enter." After being in the directory i inputted "ls" to listed the
content of the selected directory. What was displayed was two files "message.gpg" and "tryhackme.key," "message.gpg" was the message we had to decrypt, so i then had to import the "tryhackme.key" first before
decrypting "message.gpg." I did this by inputting "gpg --import tryhackme.key," then pressed "enter." I was then able to decrypt the "message.gpg" file by inputting "gpg --decrypt message.gpg," and figured out the
secret word was "Pineapple."
