## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding the basics of public key cryptography (PKC), which is the foundation for the most secure communication, authentication, and digital trust in
today's world. I also learned the importance of understanding the common uses of asymmetric encryption in PKC, which is that it gives you context - so it's not just "math with keys," but a practical too you
know when and how to apply. Then i learn the importance of understanding RSA in PKC, which is like the "alphabet" of asymmetric encryption. Even if you later move on to more advanced or modern algorithms,
knowing RSA gives you the solid base to understand the rest.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

> After launching AttackBox, i logged in using SSH with user "user" and password "Tryhackme123" to IP Address "10.201.81.144."

> I was then given a practical to do at the end of the room. I had to use GPG to decrypt the message that was in "~/Public-Crypto-Basics/Task-7" and retrieve the secret word To do this, I first had to change
directories to up to "Task-7," so first i inputted "cd /home/user/Public-Crypto-Basics," pressed "enter," then inputted "cd Task-7," then pressed "enter." After being in the directory, I input "ls" to list the
contents of the selected directory. What was displayed were two files: "message.gpg" and "tryhackme.key." "message.gpg" was the message we had to decrypt, so I then had to import the "tryhackme.key" first before
decrypting "message.gpg." I did this by inputting "gpg --import tryhackme.key," then pressing "enter." I was then able to decrypt the "message.gpg" file by inputting "gpg --decrypt message.gpg," and figured out the
secret word was "Pineapple."
