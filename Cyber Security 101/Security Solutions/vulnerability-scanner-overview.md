## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding vulnerability scanning and its types, which involves identifying weaknesses before attackers do. Knowing it helps you prioritize fixes, reduce
attack surface, prove compliance, and measure security posture over time - all skills defenders and hiring managers care about. Next, I learned about the importance of understanding the tools used for
vulnerability scanning, which is that they're how you actually find, verify, and prioritize weaknesses. Tools turn theory into evidence you can act on - they expose open ports, bad configs, vulnerable
libraries, and web-app flaws so teams can patch, mitigate, and measure security improvements. I then learned about the importance of understanding an OpenVAS vulnerability scanner demonstration, which is
that it teaches you how vulnerability scanners actually find weaknesses, how to interpret real reports, and how to turn noisy findings into prioritized fixes - all practical skills for vulnerability
management, SOC, and security engineering.

*** Practical Exercise ***

> After reading the sections within the Vulnerability Scanner Overview, I was given a practical exercise at the end to review a report of a vulnerability scan conducted by a reputable firm. For the first
question, I had to determine the score of the single high-severity vulnerability identified in the scan. To figure this out, I just opened the "Vulnerability_Scanning_Report.html" file that was located on
the THM Desktop by double-clicking on the file. After scrolling down to the section "Security Issues for Host 127.0.0.1," I saw that the level of severity was 10.

> For the next question, I had to determine the solution suggested by OpenVAS for the vulnerability. So I basically scrolled down further in the report and saw that the solution was to
"Change the password of the mentioned account(s)."
