## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding vulnerability scanning and its types which is that it finds weaknesses before attackers do. Knowing it helps you prioritize fixes, reduce
attack surface, prove compliance, and measure security posture over time - all skills defenders and hiring managers care about. Next i learned about the importance of understanding the tools used for
vulnerability scanning which is that they're how you actually find, verify, and prioritize weaknesses. Tools turn theory into evidence you can act on - they expose open ports, bad configs, vulnerable
libraries, and web-app flaws so teams can patch, mitigate and measure security improvements. I then learned about the importance of understanding a OpenVAS vulnerability scanner demonstration which is
that it teaches you how vulnerability scanners actually find weaknesses, how to interpret real reports, and how to turn noisy findings into prioritized fixes - all practical skills for vulnerability
management, SOC, and security engineering.

*** Practical Exercise ***

> After reading the sections within Vulnerability Scanner Overview i was given a practical at the end to review a report of vulnerability scan that was conducted by a reputable firm. For the first question
i had to figure out the score of the single high-severity vulnerability found in the scan. To figure this out i just opened the "Vulnerability_Scanning_Report.html" file that was located on the THM
Desktop by double-clicking on the file. After scrolling down to the section of "Security Issues for Host 127.0.0.1" i saw that the level of severity was 10.

> For the next question i had to figure out the soulution that was suggested by OpenVAS for the vulnerability. So i basically scrolled down furthur in the report and saw that the solution was to
"Change the password of the mentioned account(s)."
