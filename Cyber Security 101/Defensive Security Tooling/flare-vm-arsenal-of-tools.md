# [Defensive Security Tooling]

**Lab Topic**: [FlareVM: Arsenal of Tools]  
**Date Completed**: [10/05/2025]

## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding the tools inside the FlareVM because FlareVM bundles the exact tools you'll need to do real Windows malware analysis, incident response, and
reverse engineering - in a safe, reproducible environment. Knowing those tools teaches you the workflows, artifacts, and thinking that separate a competent analyst from someone who "runs AV." Next,
I learned about the importance of understanding how to effectively use tools to analyze potentially malicious processes. If you can quickly and accurately analyze a suspicious process, you can stop
an attack, find the root cause, extract IOCs, harden systems, and make decisions that save time, money, and data. Finally, I learned the importance of understanding the tools used for static analysis of
malicious documents and binaries, which is because static analysis is the fastest, safest way to triage and understand suspicious documents & binaries without executing them. Mastering the static toolset
lets you find indicators, determine risk, prioritize incidents, and build detections - all while avoiding the danger of running unknown.

*** Commonly Used Tools For Investigation: Overview ***

> After reading the sections within FlareVM: Arsenal of Tools, I was assigned my task under the "Commonly Used Tools for Investigation: Overview" section. I had to figure out under which process we could
find "smss.exe" by using the "procexp" tool. To figure this out, I first launched the "procexp" tool from the "Desktop," and saw that the "smss.exe" was under the process "System."

> I then had to determine the SHA256 value of the file "cryptominer.bin" located in the Desktop\Sample folder using PEStudio. To figure this out, I first went to the Desktop, double-clicked on
"Sample" folder to open it, and select the "cryptominer.bin" file.

> <img width="672" height="399" alt="fvm3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96809c18-be42-4c88-a086-573e9b8ae8d8" />

> I then opened the "PEStudio" application, dragged the "cryptominer.bin" file into it, and saw that the SHA-256 value was "E9627EBAAC562067759681DCEBA8DDE8D83B1D813AF8181948C549E342F67C0E."

> <img width="1084" height="328" alt="fvm4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/621b60b5-3ad9-4b99-ac21-d0707d1bfff8" />

> I then had to determine how many functions the same file, "cryptominer.bin", had. To figure this out, I kept the "PEStudio" application open and navigated to the left and selected the
"functions" sections. After selecting that section, I retrieved a total of "102" functions.

> Next, I had to figure out the MD5 of a file named "possible_medusa.txt", which was held in the Desktop\Sample folder using the CFF explorer application. So to figure this out, I opened the "Sample"
folder that was on the Desktop and selected the "possible_medusa.txt" file.

> <img width="725" height="423" alt="fvm6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5013af0e-743a-4974-b9ee-3d2f0ae18042" />

> I then opened the CFF Explorer application, dragged the "possible_medusa.txt" file into it, and saw that the MD5 value was "646698572AFBBF24F50EC5681FEB2DB7."

> <img width="656" height="485" alt="fvm7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fd304d-b1a0-4a46-b528-2072325a26c3" />

> Next, I had to figure out the "e_magic value" of the same "possible_medusa.txt" file by using the same application, so to do this, I just navigated to the left of the application and selected "DOS
Header" section and saw that the "e_magic value" was "5A4D."

> <img width="705" height="271" alt="fvm8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3202b27-8325-4a71-8edb-858c66d54f22" />

*** Analyzing Malicious Files! ***

> For my next practical, I first determined the "entropy value" of the "windows.exe" file. To figure this out, I first had to navigate to the Desktop, then double-click on the "Sample" folder, then
select the "windows.exe" file.

> <img width="752" height="425" alt="fvm9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1763e62f-bd1a-45f9-b6ab-ee29ae3e54a1" />

> I then had to open the "PEStudio" application and drag the "windows.exe" file into the application, which returned the "entropy value" of "7.999."

> <img width="968" height="415" alt="fvm10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b691dd5-241b-4391-81ea-0dab8080b2d2" />

> I then had to figure out the value under "requestedExecutionLevel" of the same "windows.exe" file. To figure this out, I kept the "PEStudio" application open, navigated to the "administrator section,"
scrolled through the script and saw that the value under "requestedExecutionLevel" was "requireAdministrator."

> <img width="993" height="287" alt="fvm11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a84eb147-b899-406e-b266-9296f98c2ba7" />

> Moving on, I had to figure out the Imphash of "cobaltstrike.exe." To figure this out, I first had to navigate back to the "Sample" folder and select the "cobaltstrike.exe" file, then drag the file into
the "PEStudio" application and retrieved the "Imphash" of "92EEF189FB188C541CBD83AC8BA4ACF5."

> <img width="831" height="525" alt="fvm12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03869f24-fe5d-4507-bace-17669b6bc0c8" />

> I then had to figure out both the defanged IP address to which the process "cobaltstrike.exe" is connecting, and the destination port number used by "cobaltstrike.exe" when connecting to its C2
IP address. To figure this out, I first had to navigate to the Desktop, double-click on the "Sample" folder, then double-click on the "cobaltstrike_capture.pcapng" file, which opened up the "Wireshark"
Application, I then navigated to the top of the application, selected "Display Filters," and selected the "+" icon to add a filter. After selecting the "+" icon, I added a filter that contained
"ip.addr == 47.120.46.210" as the expression. The reason why I added that specific IP address was that it was the IP address to which the process "cobaltstrike.exe" is connecting, as shown in the
process monitor application. So the defanged IP address was "47[.]120[.]46[.]210."

> <img width="694" height="540" alt="fvm15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78efe95b-d1e1-45ce-812a-1d8d8a1fc992" />
> <img width="788" height="205" alt="fvm13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9633444-884e-4b39-8a27-dcbd79742a82" />

> To retrieve the destination port number, I then went back to "Wireshark" and navigated to the top of the application, selected the top input field, and entered the filter I created earlier, which was
"ip.addr == 47.120.46.210" to filter out all the packets for packets containing only this filter expression. After clicking the "Go" button, the destination port number that was returned was "81."

> For the last question, I had to figure out the parent process of "cobaltstrike.exe." To figure this out, I just launched the "Process Explorer" application, went back to the "Sample" folder,
double-clicked on the "cobaltstrike.exe" file, went back to the "Process Explorer," and saw that the parent process of "cobaltstrike.exe" was "explorer.exe."
