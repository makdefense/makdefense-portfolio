## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching AttackBox, I had to look for a password submitted by a user within a packet. I launched "Wireshark" application, then opened "/home/ubuntu/Documents/randy-chromium.pcapng,"  next i scrolled to packet "366," then
right-clicked on it, i then selected "protocol preferences," then "TLS," then "Open Transport Layer Security preferences.." After open TLS preferences i then clicked on the second "Browse" button within the popup, then selected
the "Documents" tab, then within the "Documents" tab i selected the "ssl-key.log," then pressed the "open" button. After the second pop-up closed i was back at the first pop-up then pressed the "ok" button. Next i double-clicked on
packet 366, then selected the "Decrypted TLS (141 bytes)" tab and clicked on the lines of "0040 & 0050" to retrieve the hidden flag "THM{B8WM6P}."
