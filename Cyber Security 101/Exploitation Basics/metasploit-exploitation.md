*** Scanning Practicals ***

> After launching the THM AttackBox, i then ran Metasploit by inputting "msfconsole," then "enter," and was given my first practical which was to find out how many open ports they were on the target system. To do
this i input "nmap -sS 10.10.96.65," then "enter." The reason why i used the nmap command was because it is more faster to conduct scans on a target system within Metasploit.

> I then had to figure the NETBIOS name by using the relevant scanner. To do this
>

> I then had to figure out what was running on port 8000. To do this i inputted the command "nmap -sV 10.10.183.249," then "enter" which displayed "webfs/1.21" on port 8000.

> Next I had to figure out "penny" user's SMB password. To do this i had to implement the wordlist that was mentioned in the previous task and then switch to the "smb_login" module by inputting the command
"search smb_login," then "enter," then "use 0."

> I then had to set the RHOSTS to the target machine's ip address by inputting "set RHOSTS 10.10.135.248," then "enter."

> Then had to set the pass_file module to the wordlist given in the previous task by inputting "set pass_file /usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt," then "enter," then "show options" to make
sure it was set correctly.

> Then had to set smbuser to "penny" by inputting "set smbuser penny," then "enter," then "show options" to confirm it was set.

> Finally, i had to run the smb_login module to retrieve "penny" user's password by inputting "run," then "enter," and got the password "leo1234."
