> After launching the THM AttackBox, I launch the terminal application and was given a practical to scan and figure out what exploit the mahcine was vulnerable to. To do this, i first had to
scan the machine using nmap by inputting the command "nmap -sV -vv --script vuln 10.201.19.15," then "enter."

> After the scan was complete i then had to figure out how many ports were open with a port number under 1000. I did figured it out by scrolling through the nmap scan information and saw that there were three
open ports with a port number under 1000.
