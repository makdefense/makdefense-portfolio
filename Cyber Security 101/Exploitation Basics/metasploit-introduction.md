## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the importance of understanding the main components of Metasploit, which is that it teaches you the language of exploitation, maps out the attacker's kill chain, and prepares you to
both simulate real-world attacks and defend against them. I also learned about the importance of understanding the Msfconsole, which is that it is the center of Metasploit - it gives you complete control, speed, and
flexibility while teaching you how real attackers operate. It's not just a tool; it's a training ground for understanding the exploitation process in depth. Finally, I learned the importance of working with modules
in Metasploit, which gives you complete control over the framework, teaches you how real attacks are structured, and makes you effective at both offense and defense.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Screenshots

> After launching the THM AttackBox, I read through the information provided on the main components of Metasploit, then Msfconsole, and was given a practical to figure out who provided the
"auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login" module using Metasploit within Linux. To figure this out, I first input "msfconsole" to launch the Metasploit program, then input the command "use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login"
First, select the module. After getting into the module, I then input "info" to display who provided the module, which was the user "todb."

> I was given a practical to work with modules. I had to set the LPORT to "6666," but first, I had to connect to the "exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue)" module. To do this, I input "use
exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue," then "enter" button.

> I then input the command "set LPORT 6666" and pressed the "Enter" button.

> To confirm that the LPORT was set to 6666, I input the command "show options."

> I then had to set the global value for RHOSTS to "10.10.19.23." To do this, I simply input "setg RHOSTS 10.10.19.23" and then press the "Enter" button.

> To confirm that RHOSTS was set to 10.10.19.23, I entered "show options" and then pressed "enter."

> Finally, I carried out the exploitation phase by using the "exploit" command and observed that no session was created, nor were any vulnerable targets identified.

## Reflection

> This lab provided me with knowledge about Metasploit's Intro and how to use the program for simple tasks.
