## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> Launch Ubuntu Linux for the first time, input two new commands within the OS "echo" and "whoami." i use used the command "whoami" to find out the username of who i was logged
in as. Afterwards i used the "ls" command to see all the files and folders that exist within the system. Then changed the directory to find which folder has a file by using the "cd" command. Found
that folder 4 contained a note.txt file. Afterward i used the command "cat" to output the contents of the exact note.txt file. Then used the "pwd" to find the full path of the
"folder4" folder. Finally i started searching for files using the "find" command, then specifically used the "Grep" command on the access.log to find a flag.

## Reflection

> This lab taught me an introduction on how to input basic commands, find files, change the directory, output contents of a file, find the full path to a folder on the OS, and
search for requested files in Ubuntu Linux.
