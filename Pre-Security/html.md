## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> To Fix cat image 2 i had to correct the html by adding .jpg in the line of script of <img src='img/cat-2'>.
To display the dog image on the HTML editor i then had to add another img tag (<img>) on line 11 then type the dog image loaction so the
line of script was <img src='img/dog-1.png'>
