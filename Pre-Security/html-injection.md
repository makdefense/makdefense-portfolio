## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> To implement the injection first i had to create an html link for http://hacker.com so the code i used to create it was <a href="http://hacker.com">Visit hacker.com</a>,
afterwards i took that same line of code and input it into "What's my name" field clicked "say hi" button to display "Welcome Visit hacker.com" and was able to implement the HTML
injection.
