# [Linux Fundamentals]

**TryHackMe Path**: [Pre-Security]  
**Lab Topic**: [Interacting With Linux-1]  
**Date Completed**: [07/04/2025]

## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I used TryHackMe to launch Ubuntu Linux and interacted with it for the first time. The importance of learning these new commands for the first time was to learn them, so I would be able to investigate
logs in the future.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> Launch Ubuntu Linux for the first time, and input two new commands within the OS: "echo" and "whoami." I used the "whoami" command to determine the username under which I was logged in.
Afterwards, I used the "ls" command to see all the files and folders that exist within the system. Then, I changed the directory to find the folder that contains a file using the "cd" command. Found
that folder 4 contained a note.txt file. Afterward, I used the command "cat" to output the contents of the exact note.txt file. Then, I used the "pwd" to find the full path of the
"folder4" folder. Finally, I started searching for files using the "find" command, then specifically used the "Grep" command on the access.log to find a flag.

## Reflection

> This lab provided an introduction to basic commands, file input and output, directory navigation, and searching for files in Ubuntu Linux.
