## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I used the TryHackMe JavaScript Editor to modify the rendered HTML code to "Hack The Planet" and added a "Click Me" button to the HTML page. The importance of my doing so was to learn the DevTool
JavaScript Editor and be able to inspect, test, and manipulate how a webpage behaves in real-time.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> To change the rendered HTML code to "Hack The Planet," I first added the JavaScript to the document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet"; in line 9 then clicked
Render HTML and JavaScript code to display "Hack The Planet" and add the "Click Me" button to the HTML page. I added "<button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";'>Click Me!</button>"
between lines 7 and 8.

## Reflection

> This lab taught me how to add changes to a demo's element using javascript code and how to also add "onclick" events to execute javascript when the event occurs.
