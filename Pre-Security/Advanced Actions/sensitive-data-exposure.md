## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I found a hidden password within the source code of a website on THM. The importance of doing this lab was to be able to learn to think like a hacker because hackers like to inspect the page source code, looking for
Hardcoded credentials, API keys, hidden input fields, Commented-out sensitive information, and misconfigured JavaScript. As a cybersecurity professional, I must be able to find and report these mistakes developers sometimes make because in
In secure environments, passwords shouldn't be in a page's source code.
