## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I used TryHackMe's HTML editor to fix the cat image 2 and add a dog image to the HTML page. The importance of my doing this was because images on a webpage are a
core part of how websites communicate visually, and editing those cat and dog images ensured the site would be functional, accessible, and secure.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> To fix the cat image 2, I had to correct the HTML by adding .jpg in the line of script of "<img src='img/cat-2'>."
To display the dog image on the HTML editor, I then had to add another img tag (<img>) on line 11, then type the dog image location so the
line of script was "<img src='img/dog-1.png'>"

## Reflection

> This lab taught me how to insert images into an HTML page and how to optimize images for use on an HTML page.
