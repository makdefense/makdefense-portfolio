how to defend against them.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> To implement the injection, first I had to create an HTML link for http://hacker.com, so the code I used to create it was "<a href="http://hacker.com">Visit hacker.com</a>,"
Afterwards, I took that same line of code and input it into the "What's my name" field, clicked the "say hi" button to display "Welcome Visit hacker.com," and was able to implement the HTML
injection.

## Reflection

> This lab taught me how to implement HTML injection on a mock website's input field using an HTML link.
