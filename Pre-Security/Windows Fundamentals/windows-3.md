## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned about the built-in Microsoft tools that help keep the device secure. The importance of learning about "update information" in Windows is that knowing about the security that updates bring
which is that it fixes vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit, updates also improves system performance and reduce crashes, knowing the different types can help manage them better, lastly updates is crucial
to managing large networks securely. Learning about the different areas in Windows Security is vital because it helps me to understand how to protect the system comprehensively and effectively. Lastly, the importance
of learning about VSS is that it plays a key role in Windows system backup, recovery, and data protection.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching Windows, I checked when the two definition updates were installed on the virtual machine. I did this by clicking the "settings" app, then scrolling to "update & security," then,
"view update history," then clicked the drop-down of "definition updates (2)." Next, I navigated through the security section and saw that the "Virus & Threat Protection" area needed reviewing. I
did that by clicking "update & security," then "windows security." Since this is just a virtual machine provided by THM, there's no need for me to fix the issue. Following, I navigated through
the "virus & threat protection settings" and after clicking the "manage settings" option under it, I saw that "real-time protection" needed to be turned on. I then navigate to "firewall & network protection"
to learn about the different firewalls used on the Operating System. I then navigated to "Device Security" within the "Settings" app to familiarize myself with those settings. Then I read some information
about BitLocker and why it should be used. Unfortunately, the feature wasn't available in the virtual machine, so I couldn't test it out. Next, I navigated to "VSS" to get familiar with those settings. I
did this by clicking the "start" button, then the "search" button, searching "this PC," right-clicking on "Local Disk (C:)" and selecting "Configure Shadow Copies."

## Reflection

> This lab provided me with knowledge on "Update Information" in the Operating System, the different areas in Windows Security, Virus & Threat Protection, Firewall & network protection, App & browser, and device
security, BitLocker, and VSS.
