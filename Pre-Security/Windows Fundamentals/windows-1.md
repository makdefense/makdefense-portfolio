## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching windows within my browser, i took a navigation tour throughout the GUI. I figured out how to hide/disable the Search box by clicking "Hidden," I figured out how to
hide/disable the Task View Button by clicking "Show Task View Button," then figured out what other Icon was visible in the notification center other than the Clock and Network which
was the Action Center.
