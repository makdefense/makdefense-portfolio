## ðŸ§  Summary

> In this lab, I learned how to launch the Windows operating system in general. Also, how to navigate through the GUI, which is essential because I want
to learn foundational computer literacy and how to troubleshoot/problem solve matters faster. Thirdly, the importance of my learning how to navigate
through user accounts, profiles, and permissions is to get used to security/access control, understand profiles/data isolation, and get used to
basic cybersecurity operations. Following the importance of learning how to navigate through the computer's settings is to know about security configurations,
network/internet management, user account management, troubleshooting/updates, and career-readiness in IT & Cybersecurity. Next, I learned how to navigate through
the Operating System's Control Panel. The importance of learning this is to gain access to deeper system management tools that aren't available in the basic settings
app. Finally, I learned how to navigate through the task manager. The importance of this is to get knowledge of the system in real time, i.e., know the CPU, memory,
disk, and network usage, along with what apps and processes are running. Also, being able to spot malware or suspicious activity.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching windows within my browser, I took a navigation tour throughout the GUI. I figured out how to hide/turn off the Search box by clicking "Hidden," I figured out how to
hide/disable the Task View Button by clicking "Show Task View Button," then figured out what other Icon was visible in the notification center other than the Clock and Network which
was the Action Center. Following this, I figured out how to navigate through the different user accounts and profiles, and also checked what permissions are granted to each user account. For the
user "TryHackMeBilly," I checked their account properties by right-clicking the start button, then clicked run and searched for "lusrmgr.msc" in the search bar. What popped up after was
the different users within the system. To check "TryHackMeBilly's" properties, I clicked on the user, then clicked the "member of" tab and saw he was a member of the two groups "Remote Desktop
Users" and "Users." Next, I figured out how to navigate through the control panel and changed the view of the settings to "small icons" by clicking "Start," then "Control Panel."
Then, I clicked "View by:" and selected "small icons." I discovered that the last computer setting was called "Windows Defender Firewall." Finally, I figured out how to navigate through the task
manager and view details on the current processes that are running on the operating system by right clicking on the search bar at the left corner and selecting "task manager," then clicking
"More details."
