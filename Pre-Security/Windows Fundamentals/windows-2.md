## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After launching Windows for the second time i started the system configuration by clicking the "start" button then the "search" icon and searched for
"MSconfig" and clicked it to launch the system configuration app. Afterwards i searched through the different services to figure out with manufacture was for the
service titled "PsShutdown" which was manufactured by System Internals. I then navigated to find who the windows license was registered to by clicking the tab
titled "Tools" then selecting "About Windows" then clicked launch which showed it licensed under "Windows User." I then figured out the command for Windows
Troubleshooting which was "C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.Troubleshooting" by clicking "Windows Troubleshooting" in the "Tools" tab. I then figured
out the command that would open the "Control Panel" by clicking on the "Tools" tab and clicking on "System Properties" what was displayed was "control.exe." After navigating
through the system configurations i learned the command to change the "UAC Settings" by clicking the "Tools" tab. Next figured out the command to open "Computer Management"
which was "compmgmt" by inputting it in the search bar by clicking the "start" button. I then checked what time the "GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA" task was configured to run every day
by loading up the Computer Management App and clicking "Task Scheduler" Tab and scrolled through the different task names and found it updates at 6:15am everyday. Following I discovered
the name of a hidden folder that is shared which was called "sh4redF0Ld3r" by clicking the "Shared Folders" tab then the sub tab titled "Shares." After launch the "System Information" app
by searching the command "msinfo32" in search bar after clicking the "Start" button i checked to see what was listed under "System Name" which was "THM-WINFUN2" by navigating to the
"System Summary" tab. From there i then figured out the value for the "CompSec" which was under the "Environment Variables" which was "SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe." Then i launched
"Resource Monitor" by searching the command "resmon" in search bar after clicking "Start" button. After launching the "Command Prompt" with the command "cmd" i displayed detail
information by inputting the command of "ipconfig /all," then to figure out the full command for the Internet Protocol Configuration" i searched "System Configuration" in the search
bar and selected the "Tools" tab and scrolled then selected "Internet Protocol Configuration," the command was "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k %windir%\system32\ipconfig.exe."
