## ðŸ“Š Analysis

> After making a GET request to http://tryhackme.com/room page it successfully took me to that room, when making another GET request to /blog page I then set
the parameter to 1 and it took me to the specific blog page, I then made a DELETE request to /user/1 page and it deleted the user,
afterwards I made a PUT request to /user/2 page with the KEY set to 'username' and the parameter set to 'admin' and it updated the user, finally I then made a
POST request to /login page with the KEY parameter set to 'thm' and VALUE parameter set to 'letmein' and it logged me in
